## Praise and Prayer Needs


Praise God for a great report from TWR-Europe about a recent baptismal service at a church in the Netherlands. One of the people who got baptized, a man named John, gave his testimony. He told the congregation that one of the things that brought him to faith was the fact that he was listening every day to the Dutch-TTB broadcasts, De Bijbel Door. Pray for John and the countless saints around the world who can also say that listening to TTB played a part in their coming to faith in Christ. May many more hear the gospel of grace and believe!


Please pray for our German producer, Rev. Woytschak, as he undertakes the great work of voicing TTB and sharing Dr. McGee‚Äôs teaching of the whole Word with his countrymen.


Pray for the newly-produced German programs to be used by God to get people deeper into His Word. Also pray for German-speaking people all over the world who will be listening via the Internet. 


Arabic speakers‚Äîespecially those residing in Europe‚Äîcontinue to be a large harvest field, desperately seeking a sense of peace and hope. Pray that the sound Bible teaching heard on TTB will reveal to them that true peace can only be found in the Prince of Peace Jesus Christ and through His Living Word, the Bible!

#### Region Highlights


* Spirituality in many Western European nations has been deadened by years of cultural-only identification with national churches. The area is in need of a revival of true faith, devoted relationship with Jesus Christ, and a passion for God's Word.
* Immigration by Arab populations has created tension and resulted in conflict and discrimination in some areas of Europe.
* Our newest language production aimed at Western Europe is Flemish, launched in 2016.
