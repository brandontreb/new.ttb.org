## Praise and Prayer Needs for Southeast Asia


FEBC’s Vietnamese Director tells us that there are an estimated 100 million people who live in Vietnam, yet there are 150 million cell phones! Also, more than 1/3 of those are smartphones. TTB-Vietnamese is being distributed to very large numbers of people through FEBC’s “audio hub” system. Pray that many more will be reached through it.


Praise God that production of our new TTB-Hmong programs is progressing well. A number of books of the Bible have been produced and are being made available to the Hmong. Already the programs are becoming very popular. Please pray that production will continue to move forward and that hearts will be prepared to hear God’s Word and the good news of salvation through faith in Christ.


Please pray that TTB taught in the Burmese language will facilitate deeper biblical knowledge for the church in Myanmar, so that people may have a better understanding of the assurance of salvation.  


Three Vietnamese languages–Hmong, Yao, and Jarai–are being distributed through SD memory cards and speaker boxes to thousands of listeners. Many of these hungry souls join together in groups to learn the Word of God. Please pray for them.


TWR was contacted by a small group of immigrants from Myanmar now living in Buffalo, New York. They don’t have a trained pastor or teacher to lead them, but the gentleman heading up the group remembered listening to the TTB programs while living in Myanmar. They plan to start using the TTB Burmese and Karen programs for their times of worship together. Please pray for the Lord’s provision and encouragement for this small group of believers who have a desire to learn more about God’s Word in their heart language.

#### Region Highlights


* Of the five remaining Communist countries in the world, two -- Laos and Vietnam -- are in southeast Asia.
* While the Vietnamese constitution promises freedom of religion, in reality this is not the case. Unregistered churches and minority Christians suffer harassment, discrimination, and persecution.
* TTB began airing in Vietnamese via TWR over shortwave radio in 2000. Our participation in FEBC’s speaker box ministry will help saturate the country with the Word of God, especially in rural areas.
* There are many religious cults and sects in the Philippines, and their false teaching is a source of confusion for many who are seeking the truth. TTB is heard in the Philippines in Cebuano, Tagalog, and Ilocano.
