#### Region Highlights


* *Thru the Bible* is based in Pasadena, California. While our main office and staff are in the United States, we partner with ministries that maintain regional offices around the world where our producers and their teams produce foreign language programs, oversee broadcasting, and take care of listener follow-up.
* We are a listener-supported ministry, and the vast majority of our support comes from listeners in the U.S. and Canada. Listeners in other countries give as they're able, but we rely almost totally on domestic giving to fund our more than 100 different language broadcasts that air on every continent of the globe.
