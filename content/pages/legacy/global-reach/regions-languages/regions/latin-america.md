## Praise and Prayer Needs for Latin America


Pray for the K’iché people living in the northern highlands of Guatemala who hear *Thru the Bible* in Quiché, the native language spoken in their rural communities. The K’iché are among the substantial population of Mayan descendants living in this Central American republic, which earlier this year held democratic elections after decades of civil war. 


Please pray for our many listeners throughout Latin America, that the program would be an effective tool in reaching them. 


Praise for the Dutch program going on air in the former Dutch colony of Suriname. The target audience is the mostly Muslim Suriname-Javanese people group. Pray that it will be effective in communicating the love of God that’s revealed in His Word.


John Banman, a missionary with the Evangelical Free Church of Canada, works very closely with TWR-Bolivia in their outreach to the Mennonite colonies in Bolivia. In a recent newsletter he reported: “Solar powered mega voice players [are] one more tool we used, which has the whole New Testament, Psalms, Proverbs and 89 programs of *Thru the Bible* broadcast [in Low German] loaded on it. This is an ideal tool for young Christians to use to listen to as families, or in small groups, using the player as a Bible study leader. Thanks to the church, and some individual donors, that have paid for this project.” Please pray for these listeners and thank God for His provision. It is very common for Bolivian believers to report that they came to a saving knowledge of Christ through listening on a solar radio.


Pray for efforts to expand the Quechua broadcast to reach Peru, parts of Argentina, and Spain.

#### Region Highlights


* Spanish was the first language into which Dr. McGee’s 5-year Thru the Bible program was translated, back in 1973. It’s now aired daily on the Internet, in over 30 countries around the world, and in 20 states in the U.S.
* In 1900, almost the entire Spanish-speaking population was considered Catholic. That’s no longer the case today, as religious affiliation among Spanish speakers is quite diverse depending on the country. Secularism and spiritism in Latin America have also grown significantly in the last 20 to 30 years.
