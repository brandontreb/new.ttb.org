## Praise and Prayer Needs


 For the Saber/MP3 ministry – in the Pulaar language in Mali and Tswa in Mozambique – that listening devices will be successfully distributed and that the programs will be effective in educating rural pastors, encouraging believers who have no access to churches, and bringing lost souls to Christ.  

  

Please pray that God would both guide and provide as we consider additional ministry opportunities to the people of Africa. There is a great need for sound Bible instruction. If it’s in God’s will to increase TTB’s African ministry, we want to be obedient and faithful in doing so!


## Listener Testimonials



**From Mozambique:** Jesus is the rock of our eternal salvation. Amen! That is what I learned from your program.  **From Mozambique:** I learn every day with these wonderful lessons! Today I felt a great desire to invite my brother to listen to this meditation with me. Is very important to learn about the Word of God. Simple people as we, hear the voice of God in the simplest things. God is and has been our everlasting rock. It is wonderful to know that and even better is to have the certainty of our salvation. **From Mozambique:** When I am faced with adversity I feel tempted to run away and give up. But why run if I have a God as my rock? In Him I hide myself, not to escape, but to empower myself and face difficulties with courage.  **From Mozambique:** Listening to this program, with these beautiful words, my faith was renewed. My hope was reborn, because God is really the rock of my life.
