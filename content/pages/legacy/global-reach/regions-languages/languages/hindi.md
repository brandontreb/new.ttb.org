## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From ​Odisha:** I have been listening to the program for the last six years. I have learned many secrets from the Bible by doing so. I am growing in the Lord and I receive blessings from Him consistently. **From Uttar Pradesh:** I used to be a very depressed person and the power of darkness ruled my life. I would often fight and beat my wife and children. In fact, I wanted to be separated from my family. One day I happened to listen to the program while I was searching for some entertainment on the radio. While I was listening to it I heard that we should love one another and since then I decided to show more love to my wife and children. Since then I have been regularly listening to the program. Today my family is leading a very peaceful and joyful life, thanks to the program. **From Jharkhand:** I listen to the radio program very attentively. I have received many blessings through the program. I have come to know about my Savior through this program and I have accepted Him as my Savior and Lord. I am thankful to God and TWR for this wonderful program. **From Uttar Pradesh:** I am a regular listener of your program and I like it very much. I have learned about God and God’s Word by listening to it. I receive peace and joy through the program. Please pray for me and my friends. **From Uttar Pradesh:** I used to live in a difficult situation before. I was very depressed and there was no peace in my life. I was fed up with my life and thought of ending it. At this point I came across the program. I received a new kind of peace and joy after listening to it. Then I continued listening to it. Now my life has changed and I am a new person now. I understand that only Jesus can give us the fullness of peace and joy.
