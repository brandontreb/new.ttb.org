## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Bihar:** I belong to a different religious background. I am a student, studying for my intermediate program in Arts. It so happened that I once went to church, just curious to know what it was about. There I heard about your radio ministry and having received a program guide, I began to listen. I enjoyed it so much that I soon became a regular listener. I came to know about Jesus and He brought peace and joy into my life. Now I am very happy in the Lord and I share the Word of God with my classmates. Please pray that I win at least one person for the Lord. **From Bihar:** I belong to a village called Dhobahan. I work as a laborer to meet the needs of my family. I did not know anything about Jesus before or about your radio ministry. I was introduced to your program by a pastor who used to visit our village. He gave me a program guide, requesting me to listen to your radio program. Jesus will give you new life, he said. On that day I did not understand what he said; but now I do. Because ever since I began listening to the Bhojpuri program I have experienced the great love of Jesus. I love the Lord and I have accepted Him as my personal Lord and Savior. Since I belong to Jesus, no one can snatch me from His hands. Please pray for me and my family. **From Bihar:** I was born and brought up in a non-Christian family and used to worship the sun as god and kept fast every Friday to get good health, peace in the family, and for the jobs of my two sons. Once a servant of God came to my village and shared the Word of God with me and told me about God who is our Creator and has made the sun, moon, and all the things in this world. He also told me about Jesus and His death on the cross for mankind. He also introduced to me your radio program and I started listening to the broadcast and soon came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. Please pray for me and my family. **From Bihar:** Though I was born into a non-Christian family, I regularly listen to your radio program. We have also received the radio messages because of which we are able to listen to the Word of God at our home. I was very much worried about my children’s future, but when I started listening to the Word of God, I committed all my worries into Jesus’ hands. Besides, I have completely surrendered my life to Jesus Christ and I have learned how to pray to Him and depend on Him. This has given us joy and peace.
