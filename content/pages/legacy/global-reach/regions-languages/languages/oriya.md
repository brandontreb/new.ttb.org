## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From ​Odisha:** My family and I listen to your program regularly. As the Word of God says, His compassions fail not because of His great love and therefore we are not consumed. The Bible study enlightens us into the deeper meaning of the Word of God and brings great joy to our home. We have been able to solve many problems through His grace. The way you present the Word is very simple; it helps us understand easily. It turns a situation of hopelessness to a living hope. The Lord has been answering our prayers. Kindly pray for our family, that we may grow more in the Lord. **From ​Odisha:** I am a regular listener of your program. The meaningful program helps me walk in the light. It is my only source of hearing the Word of God in detail. I am especially blessed by your booklet. After reading it, I was made aware that I desperately need a Saviour. So far, my sin has kept me away from the Holy God. I need forgiveness of sins. I realize that a good deed cannot guarantee a place in heaven. It is by faith alone; faith in Jesus, the son of the living God that I can enter heaven. I have now put my complete trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and I have asked Him to forgive all my sins. Hence, I am now a new creature in Jesus Christ, and I have been granted the heavenly peace. Kindly send me more books and pray for me. **From ​Odisha:** Your program has brought many spiritual changes in my life. Before I knew and accepted Jesus Christ as my personal savior I was involved in all types of worldly affairs and evil deeds. My sister was attacked by an evil spirit. But by the power of prayer she recovered from her sickness and is now well. Please pray for me and my family that we may draw closer to God. **From ​Odisha:** Your program has influenced me a great deal. Earlier I was not reading the Bible and I nurtured bitter hatred against many. But ever since I began listening to your program, reading the Bible and going to church, I am good to everyone. I owe this change in me to your radio ministry. I am grateful to you. I have introduced your radio program to my friends. Please pray for me and all at our home that they may grow in the Lord.
