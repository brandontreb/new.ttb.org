## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the distribution of TTB programs on Secure Digital (SD) cards in the Banjara and Gondi languages in India. Pray that God will lead TWR to the right partners to form home listening groups among these populations.  

  

Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort ‚Äì both physical and spiritual ‚Äì in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Madhya Pradesh:** I come from a different religious background and I belong to the lowest caste. From my childhood I had heard about Jesus, the Christian God. Seeing some people give money to lure us into becoming Christians, I hated Christians. I opposed them and was cruel to them. I even insulted a person who told me about Christ. You will need Jesus at some point in your life, the person replied. As time progressed I got a job but there was no peace in my life. To make matters worse, I met with an accident and was paralyzed. This put a lot of burden on my wife who had to work and take care of me. I felt hopeless and broken. No amount of money spent on treatment could bring about a cure. When everything was silent one day my wife came into my room, bringing both our children with her. She turned on the radio so I could listen to some songs, hoping that it would improve my mood. As she was tuning the radio we heard the name Jesus in Gondi language. I asked her to stop there and we listened to the program. The message touched my heart and I remembered all those times when people told me about Jesus. I repented there and then and accepted Jesus as my savior. Jesus actually touched me that day because from that day I began to feel a slight sensation in my arms. I continued listening to the program regularly and my faith in the Lord increased. I continued to pray for my healing and soon I experienced the powerful touch from God. I now attend church regularly and encourage others to listen. I give all glory and honor to the living Lord Jesus for my transformation. **From Madhya Pradesh:** I live in a village called Mothidhana. When my mother left me, I lived like an orphan and my future seemed very bleak. I had no one to turn to as I felt uncared for and unwanted. Someone led me to an orphanage and that‚Äôs where I lived for some time. There was a fellow-resident there who spent a lot of time listening to the radio daily. I found it quite strange and so I went up to her and asked her what she listened to so intently. She smiled, asking me to sit with her and listen. I did as she asked and listened to the program. Though I did not understand much of it, I felt good in my heart. She then invited me to listen with her every day. You will receive blessings from God, she asserted. Ever since, I began listening to the TTB Gondi program regularly. Incredibly, God started talking to me through His Word. I realized that I needed Jesus in my life, knowing that He will never leave me nor forsake me. Therefore I accepted Christ as my savior. Two years later, I was in for a surprise. My father came for me and asked me to return home with him. It had been my prayer all along, an appeal that I consistently took to God in prayer. Jesus had answered my prayer. I thank God for the program. I now listen regularly to the program that first told me about Jesus. **From Madhya Pradesh:** We hail from village Chichgaon which is situated in dense jungle. Rarely any preacher comes to us and shares about Lord Jesus Christ. In such conditions it is only your program which brings the Word of God to us on a daily basis. Through it we could come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and by regularly listening of the same we are growing in our spiritual lives. We have a small group of 15 people and we all gather together and listen to His Word through this program **From Madhya Pradesh:** I live in a small village where no electricity is available. I have a radio through which I am attached with the world. Preachers also hardly dare to visit the village. During the Christmas time only they come and conduct the prayer meeting. In this situation your program is a gift for us from our God. He takes our spiritual care through this program. We are being built in our faith through it and God speaks with us on a daily basis. Please pray for us that we may follow your guidance and reach to the spiritual maturity. **From Madhya Pradesh:** I am thankful to the Lord for the program which helps me to live a holy life. My faith upon Jesus Christ is being strengthened through it and I have learned many important truths of the Bible through its teachings. Your program is an eye opener for me. Sometimes when I go through a situation that I cannot handle and feel weary, the Word of God comes like a perfect answer for the situation and I come out of my stress victoriously. I am very thankful to the Lord who speaks with me through this program on a daily basis.
