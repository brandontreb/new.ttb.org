## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Please pray for peace and stability in Mali where earlier this year the democratically-elected president was overthrown by a military coup. TTB has a ministry into this country in the French (African), Bambara, and Pulaar languages.  

  

Please pray that God would both guide and provide as we consider additional ministry opportunities to the people of Africa. There is a great need for sound Bible instruction. If it’s in God’s will to increase TTB’s African ministry, we want to be obedient and faithful in doing so!  

  

For the church in the Ivory Coast to take a lead in bringing reconciliation. Pray for refugees – especially children – who are fleeing the country scared, vulnerable, and often alone. Praise God the production and airing of programs continues.


## Listener Testimonials



**From West Africa:** I am a minister and I call to show you the interest of the population for your radio programs. The teachings of A Travers la Bible in the lives of our believers facilitate the pastoral ministry. Here, hundreds of listeners listen to the biblical teachings with interest and enjoyment and work on a change of mentality. All the glory is returned to the Lord. **From Cote d’Ivoire:** I gave my life last year to God thanks to your programs in the hope of being transformed because my life was miserable. Today, I make a small trade and I cultivate a small field. Pray for me that God helps me to continue the walk with Him. My parents greet you and thank you. **From Cote d’Ivoire:** I am Moslem. Since some time I listen to you on the radio here in the border of Cote d’Ivoire and Mali. Your teaching allows me to open my eyes on some preoccupations that I had since long time about God. Having received light by your message, I come to tell you that I decided to give myself to that God you preach, in order to have eternal life. Pray for me because I don’t dare to face the looks of my Moslem parents. To take the path of the church I fear the violent reactions of their part. **From Cote d’Ivoire:** I obeyed your message that I listen on Sinai radio here in the North of Côte d’Ivoire, and it made me well. Indeed, I had been married to an old man at the age of 10 years by force. Today I’m 32. And because of the fact that I didn’t have the opportunity to enjoy my childhood nor my youth life, I did hate my husband and his parents too. So I decided to have an affair with a young man of my age. When I learned through your program what could happen to the liar and especially to the adulterer, I was touched and I decided to stop this extra relation and to leave this falsity. I spoke to your God as you said, the love I had for the young man disappeared and I had another look for my aged husband. I began to love his parents. Today, I am in peace. Pray for me because I have the intention to explain everything to my husband in the goal to ask him to let me go to church. **From Cote d’Ivoire: I** would like you to pray a lot for me because my family persecutes me. As I’m a new Christian I can forsake Jesus’ hand if I’m not strong. Sustain me because I don’t want to depart from Jesus. My family prevents me to listen to you but I hide and listen to the broadcast through my cell phone and I see that God makes me good.
