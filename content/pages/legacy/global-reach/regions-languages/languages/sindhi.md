## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Goa:** The changes in me are a result of listening to [TTB]. I am blessed and my personal relations with the Lord are stronger as I grow in maturity. One thing I realized through the program is how much God loves us. What I am today I owe to the Lord Jesus Christ who died on the cross on my behalf. He has changed me completely. Please pray that God uses me for His glory. Thanks for calling me on my phone. It is interesting talking to you. Please remember me in your prayers. **From Maharashtra:** My prayers are being answered and a lot of people have started listening to [TTB]. I find it very interesting and I always invite my friends to listen with me. It gives me peace and joy. The program will one day change the hearts of my people. We need to pray for them. I understand and know the importance of this valuable program. Nobody teaches what you teach. My prayer to the Lord is that He continues this program till all our people come to the Lord. **From Maharashtra:** I love [TTB] from the bottom of my heart because it leads me to live a God pleasing life. It has brought many changes in my life. I have learned a new method of dealing with complicated matters, biblically through this program. Now all my burdens have passed away and I feel peaceful. The program really brings peace into my life on a daily basis. I have experienced the power of the messages that are delivered through the program. It is as if God speaks to me personally and guides me in the right direction. Please uplift me in your prayers. **From Maharashtra:** I am a regular listener of [TTB]. It has made a great impact on my life. It helps us keep away from sin. Earlier, I had a lot of problems in my family and personal life but this program has made me humble and now we experience peace in our family. I have noted down many biblical principles that are shared in the program and I am implementing them in my life. This strengthens my faith in Jesus. I am thankful to you for talking to me and helping me to overcome my shortcomings. Please send me booklets on the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. **From Maharashtra:** I never miss listening to [TTB]. It helps me lead a Christian life. I received the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal Savior but there was no one to teach me about faith. There were times when my faith wavered but since I began listening to [TTB], which is a systematic study of the Word of God, my faith is strong. I can speak with boldness about my faith. My relatives do not understand this and often question my faith. But I am able to respond well to them. Please pray that I may remain strong in faith.
