## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Please pray for our producer, Kim Song, and his team as they produce TTB programs in the Khmer language and minister to listeners in Cambodia.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Cambodia:** I am joyful when I hear the Word of God on air because I want all the people in Cambodia to know the Word of God, especially Jesus’ good news. I love them and I want them to receive Him as the Lord Savior in their lives. Thank you, God, for allowing your Word to be broadcast in Cambodia. Amen! **From Cambodia:** Telling the gospel to unbelievers is God’s will. This is the lesson which I have learned from the program “Thru the Bible.” This lesson encourages me to have more energy to evangelize confidently. Thank you for the program, may God bless this program, amen! **From Cambodia:** I listened to many radio programs that broadcast on air in our Cambodia but, the program which touched and encouraged my heart is “Thru the Bible.” I was changed in my faith from weak to strong. Moreover, the Word of God made me know Him more and more. Finally, I would like to thank the great God who taught me and changed me to become His son. Thank you! **From Cambodia:** Praise to the Lord for opening my family member’s heart to accept Him as the Lord Savior for their lives. I am very happy that “Thru the Bible” has changed my family to become His children. I would praise Him because He is a wonderful God of this universe, He is above all, and He can do everything. Thank you!
