## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Please pray for the situation in Nigeria, where the persecution and killing of Christians by Muslims continues to take place. Horrific stories are coming out of the Plateau State where TTB broadcasts in the local languages of Hausa and Yoruba. We also have a ministry to the nomadic Fulani people (who are responsible for many of these killings) in the Pulaar language through the distribution of media players, but most of this work is being done in Mali, which is also a hotbed of recent Christian persecution. Many of our brothers and sisters in Christ throughout West Africa endure horrible suffering on a daily basis and many have lost their lives because of their faith. Please pray for believers there and for a peaceful resolution to the violence.  

  

Please pray for those involved in our ministries in Nigeria and Kenya, as well as the local churches there that have increasingly come under attack by local Muslim extremists.  

  

Please pray that God would both guide and provide as we consider additional ministry opportunities to the people of Africa. There is a great need for sound Bible instruction. If it’s in God’s will to increase TTB’s African ministry, we want to be obedient and faithful in doing so!


## Listener Testimonials

You really help me to know God through your programmes. I pray that the Lord will give you more wisdom. God bless you. **From Kano State, Nigeria:** I write to thank you for the message of yesterday. I was blessed. I now see the light. Please I want to become a Christian, what will I do? Please help me. **From Plateau State, Nigeria:** For the past 6 years I am living in darkness, outside God’s will. But this year 2012, the Lord helped me through your programmes. Now I know the Lord. Please I need your prayers and a Holy Bible. **From Bauchi State, Nigeria:** I like your teaching very much, because you help my spiritual growth. But my husband did not want me to listen to your programmes. What should I do?
