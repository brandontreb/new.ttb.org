## Praise and Prayer Needs


 For the unstable and dangerous situation in Mexico, caused by decades of political and police corruption, the massive drug trade, poverty, as well as many other factors. Pray that these issues will not interfere with the airing of the program by radio and that many hurting souls will have access to the teaching of God’s Word and in it find assurance and peace.  

  

Last year the TTB Spanish department launched an A Través de la Biblia page on Facebook. Pray that God will use this site to cross-promote the broadcasts and expand the outreach even more.  

  

Praise for the overwhelming number of downloads of the TTB Spanish program from TWR’s Linguablast site. Pray that the Internet will continue to be an effective and far-reaching tool for ministering to people around the world.  

  

Please pray for our many listeners throughout Latin America, that the program would be an effective tool in reaching them. 


## Listener Testimonials



**From Bakersfield, California, U.S.A.:** I want to take this opportunity to express my thanks for this beautiful ministry. You have taught me every day more and more about our Lord. When the trials come and I feel weak, the Lord gives me new strength and encouragement through you. I feel loved and I can keep going. For this reason I bless you. We need to keep going forward because Jesus Christ has won the victory. **From Peru:** I want to let you know that I received the precious booklets of the notes & outlines. For me it was a great joy to discover they had been delivered to my house. I felt like the most blessed man in the universe. It’s as if God had come to visit me. The moment I received them, I went into my room, shut the door and read how beautiful God’s ways are. I really want to be a good child of God. My entire family is rejoicing and let me just tell you once again how thankful we are. We bless you and the entire ministry with your beautiful families in the love of our Heavenly Father and His son Jesus Christ. **From Medellín, Colombia:** Appreciated brothers, God bless you. Your ministry is so important because it helps me to understand the Bible more and it delivers me from false personal interpretations. The best thing is that God speaks to me many times. I always find some teaching for my life. What a great provision. I am rejoicing in the Lord because each day His mercies are new. Just so you know, I don’t waste anything. I have shared your ministry with some of my sisters at church. Blessings to you. **From Valencia, Venezuela:** God bless you brothers. As the Bible says, “Every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of Lights.” The blessings that God has showered upon you, you share with those who are hungry and in need of the Scriptures. May God continue to bless your lives greatly in a powerful and glorious way. The Lord is coming and your programs are a blessing and consolation while we wait for the Christ of Nazareth. We listen to you as a family and at work we share what we learn through the studies. Thank you for the literature. We listen to you on the Internet. We give glory to God for you because you live out the Word. “By their fruit they shall be known.” **From Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.:** It is a pleasure for me to be able to write to you to congratulate you for such a beautiful program. I discovered the program about two weeks ago while I was listening to a station from my country, El Salvador, called Radio Salem. Since then I have been listening to this website on the internet on my cell phone every day. I would love to receive the notes & outlines to be able to follow along with these wonderful studies. I learn every day from the Word of God which is marvelous and it edifies my life each day. My goal is to collect the entire collection of notes & outlines of each book of the Bible. Let me also share with you that I came to the Sates 6 years ago and I began serving the Lord. My brother and I are involved in the worship ministry in the church we attend. My brother and I were the first ones to attend the church and now my mother and all those who live in our house are serving the Lord. For this reason the notes & outlines would be such a blessing for me and my family so that we can continue to study the Word of God. I will be waiting to receive them with great joy. May our All Powerful God continue to bless you and give you strength to continue forward in the work of the Lord.
