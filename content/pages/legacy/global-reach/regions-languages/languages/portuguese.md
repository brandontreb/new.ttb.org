## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray that our programs will be a voice of biblical truth, drowning out the false teaching of cults. Pray that people would not be deceived but would be drawn by the Holy Spirit to God’s Word.  

  

Pray for unity among believers and churches.  

  

Pray for evangelism among the large numbers of immigrants flooding Portugal (Ukrainians, for example, now comprise Portugal’s second-largest community). Pray that our broadcasts would minister to those who are open to hearing the gospel.


## Listener Testimonials



**Email from Portugal:** I am one of the people who found Christ through your program. A friend of mine told me about it and I started going to church. Here, in this city, many people have come to know God through your program. We’re always talking to others about this wonderful Bible study. God bless you.  **From Porto, Portugal:** I am 30 years old and I hear your program every day. You can’t imagine how much these 30 minutes comfort me as I have changed. I always was a believer in God; imagining Him as a great friend, but I didn’t not know much about Him. A few years ago I was going to a Christian church but wrong choices and drugs transformed me. I became violent. I was not eating. I was not interested in life. I was in jail and I felt God in that place, but I fell back. Since a year ago everything has been different. Now I hear you every day and since then I’ve been at peace with me and with others! You can’t imagine what God did with my life. I’m doing community work with children and so I ask God to let me continue. I wanted to thank you for the extra strength you have given me through your program! I really say thanks. Thank you for helping me to remain closer to God, my friend! **From Portugal:** I am a listener of your program and I love it. No one can explain the Bible like Paulo Chaveiro does. It would be good for people to speak in churches like this. I started listening to your program because a friend of mine told me about it. And now I’m telling all the people I meet. The program has wonderful messages.  **From Portugal:** I’m listening to the TTB program and I love it. Could you send me a CD with recorded programs or an audio Bible? I have many problems in my eyes and I can’t read, so I would listen to the Word of God. **From Portugal:** I thank God for the messages I hear every day by radio given by Mr. Paulo Chaveiro. It is a blessing that God will open doors for this message and come into all Portuguese homes. God richly bless your ministry.
