## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Please pray that God would both guide and provide as we consider additional ministry opportunities to the people of Africa. There is a great need for sound Bible instruction. If it’s in God’s will to increase TTB’s African ministry, we want to be obedient and faithful in doing so!


## Listener Testimonials



**A listener from Tokombiya, Eritrea:** I am from the Kunama tribe, one of the nine Ethnic Groups, and a minor one. The population is estimated to 70,000. Majority follow Islamic, some Catholics, and few are Lutherans, but otherwise heathens, worshiping nature and heavenly hosts. I used to follow my parents tracks and practices that I was taught since my childhood. There is a very giant tree at the tip of a mountain near our village that people usually go for prayer and worship of their gods, sacrificing animals, drinking and eating as a dedication to their gods. They drink alcohol, got drunk. The presence of the mighty God had never ever been prevailed. The community is suffering from drought, instability and verities of crises. Having this experience and understanding, I moved out from my village, where I was brought up, to seek a job, and was hired as a house maiden in a Christian family. The wife is a devoted believer, concerned, understanding and loving. She is so approachable, and made me come close to her. She tries to meet my needs, feeding and clothing me well, even extending her support to my parents generously. Her purpose and strive was to introduce me to the Lord Jesus Christ. Attracted by her benevolent deeds, I gave attention to her efforts and calls. She was inviting me to sit with the family to listen to the Christian Radio broadcast and to be part of the Bible discussion session. At the beginning I was not interested, but reluctantly accepted it not to offend her and the household. My attitude and understanding began to change slowly. The old tradition and experience, which I was exercising since my childhood, was dominating my all being, but the truth through the Holy Spirit was also wrestling with Satan to free me from the bondage of the idols and spirits. A spiritual warfare was going on inside, making me depressed, confused and frustrated. The devil was tempting to hinder the development happening in my life, and to destroy my life. I passed through a very tough and challenging moment, I sometimes got annoyed when invited to listen to the Bible teachings, nagging and complaining. When such moments came to happen, the hosting family, knowing with whom to fight, was struggling against the authorities, against the rulers and the power of the dark, and also against the spiritual forces of evil. Eventually Satan was defeated, and I am freed from the imprisonment of darkness. Now I am enabled listening to the Bible lessons, pray and read my Bible regularly. But my people are in need of the saving gospel. They need to be reached. Hereby, I urge concerned believers, Christian brothers and sisters, to pray for those living under the rule of Satan and take the initiative to reach out to them. **From Adi Keih, Eritrea:** I am a regular listener of the Bible teachings in the radio ministry, one of those who came to know the Lord Jesus Christ through it. I already have shared the truth that I lost my sight by a bomb blast during the war and have hearing difficulties. Recently, the merciful God has helped his poor child giving the opportunity for a better medical treatment in Germany. Now my hearing is restored. What I am to tell is that, I met Eritreans and Ethiopians who follow the broadcast and the Bible teachings, I have also witnessed that they are getting blessed by it. The Lord is really reaching His people everywhere, even in Europe, through this radio ministry. Praised be His name He is so wonderful, caring and loving God.
