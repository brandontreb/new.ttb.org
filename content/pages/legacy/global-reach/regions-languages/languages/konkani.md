## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**(Location undisclosed):** I listen to your Konkani radio program every day. It is really a wonderful work of the Lord that many would know the truth through this radio program. I thank God for His wondrous work in my neighborhood. All my neighbors are now changed and they are listening to the Thru the Bible Konkani program. At 10:00pm we increase the volume so that they may receive and understand the Word of God through this program. I fully believe that one day God will turn their hearts towards Him and all my neighbors will be saved. Please pray for them also that they may know the Lord Jesus Christ as their own Savior and Lord. **From Karnataka:** I praise and thank God for your program that reaches out to people with the living Word of God. The Word of God is a reviving instrument for the drooping spirit, a weapon against the wicked one and a tool that shapes and molds one’s life. I have learned this from your daily teaching. Through your program I get the strength and courage to preach the Word to others. God is certainly using me for His ministry. **From Andhra Pradesh:** It is a great joy to read your letter. I am inspired and challenged to spend time in prayer as I listen to the broadcast prayers. God’s love and mercy fills my heart when I am in prayer. I wish that your messages reach out to the ends of the earth. Truly you are doing great work, in service of the Lord. Your reward will be great in His kingdom. Please pray that I may live a life closer to God. **From Goa:** The TWR Konkani program is a wonderful way of learning the Word of God. It gives us more details and information about the verses, their background and meaning. Every time I listen to your program, I feel a sense of peace. It frees me and at the same time emboldens me. I try to live according to God’s will and in that sense the program shapes my spiritual being. My friends and I listen to your program every night without fail and we all experience peace in our lives. I have come to know that Jesus is our only savior, deliverer and protector. I now completely trust the Lord God Almighty and thank Him for all His blessings towards my family. **From Goa:** Thanks for your response to my letter. The verses you quoted from the Word of God were encouraging. We listen to your program and are blessed by it. It has become our comfort during affliction and hope in times of depression. We consider God’s Word precious and necessary for our daily spiritual living. The revelation of God’s Word which was hidden is revealed to us; we thank God for your program which makes it possible for every person to hear and know the true and living God who is the author of salvation.
