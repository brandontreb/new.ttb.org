## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for our ministry to China. There are some exciting new ministry strategies that we are exploring to more effectively reach the world’s most populous country.   

               

The broadcast provides a channel for Chinese believers to study the Bible systematically when Christian resources are otherwise scarce. Pray that the broadcasts in Mandarin and Cantonese will help believers build a strong foundation and that they will then share that knowledge with others. Pray also that knowing the Word will help believers recognize and expose false doctrines taught by the cults.  

  

Pray that God will open new doors of ministry for our work in China. Our International Director Gregg Harris is exploring opportunities to broadcast inside the country, but there are still many obstacles to overcome.  

  

For Christians in many countries who are not able to meet together and depend on the radio broadcasts for encouragement and teaching from the Word.


## Listener Testimonials



**From China:** I have been visiting your website to listen to your programs continuously and regularly. It is because your programs help me understand more about God’s Word and know much more about Him. The programs bring me surprises and joy in the spirit, full of truth, blessings, and energy! With your help I love to read the Bible. Reading the Bible is not dull anymore, especially the books of the prophets in the Old Testament. Thank you for spending the time and effort to produce this program.  **From China:** I listened to the program on Genesis 19:17-20:11. It helps me realize the relationship between God’s blessings and the repentance of our sins. After Abram left his hometown, we saw him lying to the Egyptian officials that Sarah was his sister. He did not have faith then. After 25 years, however, Abraham did a similar thing in lying to Abimelech that Sarah was his sister. He had not dealt properly with the sin in his heart—that is, he had inadequate faith in God. Many a times, I’ve been praying for God’s blessings. I thought I just need to wait, but I was not vigilant about my life. This program reminded me to deal with my sins—to face my weaknesses, to repent of my sins and to surrender them to God; to rely on Him instead of on my own wisdom (just as Ishmael was born of the flesh, and Isaac was born of the Spirit). I will choose to make the right choice in life—to choose to live in the teachings and promises of God. **From China:** The program has given me more yearning to read the Bible. Listening to a sermon and reading the Bible on my own is different. A preacher’s teachings are very enriching with a lot of knowledge, but if I have a deeper understanding about the Bible, then I would have even more resonance when I listen. This program helps me read and appreciate the Bible better and more systematically. I think it will be particularly helpful for people who don’t know how to read the Bible, or those who like to read the Bible according to the Scriptural order.
