## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Nalbari, Assam:** I have been listening to your radio program regularly. I am from a different religious background. I really love listening to the teachings of the program. Listening to the Bible study has given me the desire to know more about the Bible. I thank you for giving me a Bible and now I am able to read it. I have come to know many new things which I had not heard before.  

  

**From Assam:** Currently I am a pastor. I live with my parents, my wife, my daughter, and son. I work in a tea factory in the Morongi Tea Estate. Previously, though I was born into a Christian family, I did not have a personal relationship with Jesus. But a believer convinced me to trust in Jesus. He also told me about your radio program and encouraged me to listen. Since then I listen regularly and I have given my life to Jesus. I want to serve Him always. I really thank God for such a wonderful program. Listening to the verse by verse explanation of the Bible has helped me grow spiritually. I am encouraged by listening to the program and in turn I have encouraged my neighbors to listen and be blessed by the program. My family and I are now able to serve the Lord because we have come to know the Word of God better than before and are now able to tell others what the Lord has done for us as He laid down His life and shed his precious blood for us.  

  

**From Assam:** I am a 20-year-old boy from a non-Christian family. I have been listening to [TTB-Assamese] for the past two years. My parents also listen to it along with me. Personally, I really like listening to your program because its teachings are unique and meaningful. I have come to know many beautiful things from them about Jesus Christ and am very much interested to know more about Christianity.  

  

**A listener testimony reported to us by our production team:** He has been listening to the Assamese TTB program since 2001. The Word of God through it has touched his heart and many definite changes have come in his life. The radio program is the only source for him to learn the Word as in his area there is neither a church nor any Christians. The program has helped him to do away with all his bad habits and live a life worthy of Christ. He thanks the Lord for making him a new creation. Today he serves the Lord full time by spreading the good news of Jesus Christ to the unreached villages like his. God is using him mightily for His glory in his own village and nearby villages and by His grace now he has been able to establish a church in his own locality. There are about 30 people attending his church. Praise the Lord!
