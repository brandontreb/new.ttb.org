## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for Christians meeting secretly in the Persian-speaking world. Pray for strength, wisdom, and boldness in their difficult circumstances. For those who are seeking God, pray that He would lead them to a believer or our Persian radio broadcast so that they can learn about His Word and believe in Christ for salvation.  

  

Pray for believers in Central Asia who face persecution for believing in and proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ. Pray as well that the governments of these countries would not increase restrictions on religious groups.  

  

Pray that the daily broadcasts into the Persian-speaking world can be continued and heard. Pray that the believers who come to the Lord via hearing these messages by radio can find other Christians or fellowships in their area.



## Listener Testimonials



**From Iran:** I am 23 years old and live in Iran with my family. We are very interested in Christianity. I have been listening to your radio programs for several years and sometimes my parents listen as well. As a young person I would pray to God, but I feared Him. In fact, it was my fear that caused me to pray and participate in religious ceremonies. When I was 20 years old I heard about Jesus for the first time from you. This slowly drew me toward Christianity. I believe that I am no longer a Muslim but in fact am a Christian. My family and I would like to become good followers of Jesus Christ. Thank you for what you have done in helping us to understand Christianity.
