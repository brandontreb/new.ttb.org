## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Please pray that God would both guide and provide as we consider additional ministry opportunities to the people of Africa. There is a great need for sound Bible instruction. If it’s in God’s will to increase TTB’s African ministry, we want to be obedient and faithful in doing so!


## Listener Testimonials



**From Kwazulu-Natal:** In 1999 because of car accident I was hospitalized for many months, and among those who used to visit us was a group of Christians. After they had prayed one woman used to talk to me about Jesus, and she also encouraged me tune in to your Bible programme when I got discharged from hospital. About three months after telling me about your programme I was discharged. To cut matters short I did as she told me, that is how I came to know Jesus as my Saviour. Your programmes are helping me, and I am growing spiritually. **From Kwazulu-Natal:** I am doing my final year at university, I want to thank God who used you to help me stand firm in faith all these years. As you know, there are all kinds of temptations at such institutions, but through your programme I grew stronger and stronger in faith. **From Gauteng:** I am a born-again business woman who travels a lot. Because of my business I spend some days in ​eSwatini, and other provinces, but what helps me spiritually is to tune in to your programme. You know I have told many people about your programme, and some do thank me that I told them. In June last year my older brother phoned me to tell me that he is now born-again. I was somehow doubtful because he never ever went to church in his life, when I asked him to tell me about it, to my surprise he mentioned TWR and your name. God used you as His instrument to lead me to Him, and now He has used you to save my brother. We thank God for TWR because through this medium it reaches even those who don’t go to church.
