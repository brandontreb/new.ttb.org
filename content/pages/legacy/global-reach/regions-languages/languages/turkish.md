## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for peace and political stability throughout the Middle East and North Africa so that the gospel may continue to be aired without disruption. Pray also that governments in this region of the world would endorse complete religious freedom. Believers in countries where those freedoms currently are not available are also in need of our prayers for protection and courage.  

  

For the safety and protection over the broadcast stations in Europe that TWR uses to broadcast to Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. TWR-Europe’s coverage area has a combined population of more than 1.2 billion people.  

  

For the church in the Arab world to stand strong and firm against chaos and that Christian people would seek God’s wisdom. Pray that the broadcasts throughout this area will be effective in speaking to the hearts of Arab listeners and that the study of God’s Word will bring about reconciliation and peace.  

  

Pray for open ears and ready hearts among the multitude of listeners who follow the programs daily. Pray that Christians in North Africa will be living testimonies of Christ’s love for their neighbors and authorities.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Turkey:** Hello, I’m listening to your programs for a while. I grow up in a Moslem family. Before I listened to your programs I believed that I’m a good person. But through your programs my understanding about sin changed. I realized what sin really is. Now I started to read a Bible. Thanks much for your programs. **From Turkey:** Hello, I’m listening since 2 years to your programs. You shared such good things in this time period that at the end I decided to accept Christ into my life. I’m very happy now. I really feel that I’m free and saved. I just wanted to thank you for that! **From Turkey:** I started to listen to your programs with Acts a few months ago. I thought you were just going to explain the Bible but you are also giving information about the Old Testament. I learned a lot about Christianity through your programs. If possible, I want to ask you to send me a Bible.
