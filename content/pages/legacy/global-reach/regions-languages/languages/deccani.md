## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Maharashtra:** I accidently happened to listen to your broadcast while I was tuning into my radio one day. Through it I came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and became a faithful follower of Him. Today, I am growing in Jesus only because of your program. **From Tamil Nadu:** I am advanced in age and I listen to programs in Tamil, Telugu, English, and Deccani. I am blessed by listening to these programs. Both my sons died in 1991 and 1995 and I am alone. I request you to send me an English Bible because I cannot buy one in this state. I have a 40-year-old Bible which I cannot use any more. **From Rajasthan:** I have been listening to your radio program regularly. It is only because of it I came to know about the living God. May He help you and bless you in all your endeavors. **From Madhya Pradesh:** I am a farmer who has studied up to the 6th standard. A regular listener, I am very much blessed through the program. Above all, it has brought me closer to God. As my parents are not believers of Jesus, kindly pray for them that they may also come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
