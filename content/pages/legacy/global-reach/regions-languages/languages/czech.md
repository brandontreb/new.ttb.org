## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Many of our listeners in Central Europe are facing instability and financial hardship in their circumstances. Ask the Lord to use the TTB broadcasts to deepen their trust in God.  

  

Many of the countries of Central Europe suffered for decades under Communist rule. While increasing levels of freedom have come to many people in this part of Europe, many of these countries have a long road of recovery ahead of them as they continue to face the devastating effects of atheistic Communism. Pray for open ears and minds and that the Holy Spirit would soften hearts to accept God‚Äôs gift of salvation through grace.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Czech Republic:** Thank you very much for regularly broadcasting the TTB programs. I listen at college on MW since I don‚Äôt have an Internet connection. I have let myself be formed by this program for quite some years, and I couldn‚Äôt count the many times listening has helped me. Thank you once again for your outstanding programs. **From Bratislava, Czech Republic:** Hello, this is one of your thankful listeners. The project of TTB is very important to me as I am sharing it with a friend who is seriously ill. She has bad sight and is limited in her motor skills. Audio production is a great resource for her as she loved reading but cannot strain her eyes. I am confident these programs are a wonderful inspiration to her in her journey of searching for God and His grace. Thank you very much. **From Zvolen, Czech Republic:** Dear brothers, it has been a half a year already since I had written to you. During the summertime I missed several sessions of the TTB program. Because of the healthy biblical teaching there is always a great interest in these programs in my neighborhood ‚Äì at my church in the town of Zvolen as well as in the nursing home Elim where so many live their autumn of life. Let me, then, ask you to send me via internet those summer sessions, as you have done before. I will do my best not to add to your work and keep up with your archive. But there is also a benefit in fact that I have to write you ‚Äì I can thank you for your ministry, it is bearing fruit not only in the Czech Republic, but also in Slovakia and other neighboring countries. **From Pre≈°ov, Czech Republic:** Greetings to you from Radio 7, members of our family! We as a family listen regularly to your radio program. Father Imrich is 84 and he had listened to your program back in the seventies of the last century when you were broadcasting from Monte Carlo. He was sightless and worked in a press room for blind people and he recorded your programs on an old tape recorder. Often he would stay up late after midnight. His ministry with these recordings had helped me as well as many others to receive the Good News. I made my personal decision to follow the Lord ‚Ä¶ and I am very aware of the big contribution of having regularly listened to TTB programs. Greetings to all of you, may God the Father bless you with all wisdom and spiritual blessings and with many newly saved listeners. That is what I pray for in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. **From V√≠tkov, Czech Republic:** We have always listened to your TTB programs as they are a great help for us. The presentation is very clear for everybody and it is always interesting no matter what chapter is being presented. Thank you and we wish blessing to all who take part in preparing it.
