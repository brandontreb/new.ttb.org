## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Madurai, Tamil Nadu:** Thank you for your valuable service of broadcasting the Word of God. I listen to your program regularly. The message of 14th February strengthened my faith. It was about the cup bearer who had forgotten Joseph after which 2 years passed by. But God did not forget Joseph. He was moving in Joseph’s life and that was the reason why Joseph was cheerful even as he glorified God in everything. I was touched by that message and I understand that I am not alone. God is with me and He is moving in my life too. **From Andhra Pradesh:** I congratulate you in the Lord, for completing the 5 years of expository preaching of the Word of God. It was indeed a great labor of love. I am delighted in the Lord as I listen to the Thru the Bible broadcast. It gives me knowledge and wisdom to know more about Him and His teachings. Through your messages I have learned to trust Him at all times and have got great peace of mind. **From Andhra Pradesh:** I tune into your “Through the Bible” program frequently but sometimes I miss to hear it so I download the program from your website. I have completed Engineering and I am in search of a job. Five months back I was unable to pray and read the Bible and even didn’t go to church on Sundays. But now I am able to pray and read the Bible regularly and am also attending the church. All this has been made possible only because of your program, as through it God’s Word touched my life and changed me. All glory to Him. There are still some weaknesses in me which are pulling me back but I know my Lord will surely help me and save me. Please pray for my complete transformation and also pray that I may be able to live a Christ-like life in this world. **From Madhya Pradesh:** I along with my mother and little daughter listen to your Thru the Bible program regularly. It is the most awesome and beautiful broadcast we have ever come across. Thanks for producing this program because through it we are learning to take Jesus and His Word seriously. Your messages have brought wonderful changes in our lives and in the lives of our loved ones. The way you present the Bible is remarkable and it is truly a blessing to our lives.
