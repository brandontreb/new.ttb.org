## Praise and Prayer Needs


Pray for Hellas, our TWR partner in Greece, and our broadcasts on commercial FM stations there. An opportunity came up to broadcast on a new station near Thessaloniki. Please pray for the provision of funds for additional airtime. 


Many of our listeners in Central Europe are facing instability and financial hardship in their circumstances. Ask the Lord to use the TTB broadcasts to deepen their trust in God.  

  

Many of the countries of Central Europe suffered for decades under Communist rule. While increasing levels of freedom have come to many people in this part of Europe, many of these countries have a long road of recovery ahead of them as they continue to face the devastating effects of atheistic Communism. Pray for open ears and minds and that the Holy Spirit would soften hearts to accept God’s gift of salvation through grace.


## Listener Testimonials



**Phone call from Cyprus:** S. called for the first time and told us that someone suggested she should listen to Greek TTB. She heard it and she is very excited about the program. When she heard about our offers, she asked us to send her a New Testament in the Modern Greek language and the Jesus DVD. **Phone call from Athos, Greece:** I am a monk on a Holy Mountain. I hear your program and it’s really nice. Would you send me the Jesus DVD please? **Testimony from Cyprus:** M. told me that she is excited and that the program is great. She is listening to the program with her husband. Her husband has his own Holy Bible and follows the words which the speaker shares. When M. heard about the offers that we give, she asked us to send her a New Testament in Modern Greek, and also the Jesus DVD. **Phone call from Cyprus:** K. asked us to send her two copies of the Jesus DVD. She said she would love to come to a church, because both she and her husband are searching for the truth. The Lord is opening doors through our radio program in an incredible way. K. said she has been listening to the radio station for many years, many hours every day.
