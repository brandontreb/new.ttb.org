## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Please pray for Wakshuma Terefe, the voice of TTB in the Oromo language. In January 2013 he and his wife, Hanna, lost their third child – a son – during his birth. Join us in asking the God of all comfort to sustain the Terefe family during this exceptionally difficult time, surround them with His peace, and restore their joy.  

  

The UN is reporting that “up to 2,000 Somali refugees cross into Ethiopia each day. Thousands also seek refuge in neighboring Kenya.” Aid agencies are appealing for tens of millions of dollars in emergency funding to fight a drought that has created a triangle of hunger where the borders of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia meet. Please remember this situation in your prayers – that the TTB programs in Swahili, Amharic, Oromo, and Somali will bring a message of hope to those who are suffering so much during this terrible drought and famine.  

  

Please pray that God would both guide and provide as we consider additional ministry opportunities to the people of Africa. There is a great need for sound Bible instruction. If it’s in God’s will to increase TTB’s African ministry, we want to be obedient and faithful in doing so!


## Listener Testimonials



**From Ethiopia:** I have been listening to your TTB radio program for the last four years. Since I became a regular listener to the program I can say that I have been changed to the new life –the life that is led by the Holy Spirit. How peaceful it is living with Jesus! By now I would be in the darkness if your radio program was not on the air. Praise to Jesus! I am living the happiest life since I found and became regular listener to TTB radio program. God bless you. **From Ethiopia:** I am your active listener to your radio program and I am telling to friends and relatives to give their spare time to listen to the radio program that is broadcasting a sweet message and Bible education every evening. I myself benefited a lot of things including received my healing via this program. One day while I was going to the small shop for purchasing some stuff I just heard your radio program loudly and a few people were gathered to listen to the program. I was very amazed and I asked the owner of the shop. He answered humbly that he gained a lot of things both for his soul and for his social interaction. Actually it is surprising finding such devoted person in such busy town. I just call you to share my witness what I saw. I will tell and advise my friends and my relatives about TTB radio program. God bless you! **From Ethiopia:** “Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates correction is stupid.” (Proverbs 12:1) TTB radio program presents a lovely program that makes me to be fascinated with all lessons. One day I heard the unique radio program in one of my relative’s house where I went to visit with my parents in another area. It was sweet like honey. I was followed for some days until we return to our home. After I returned back to home I was not able to have to listen to such type of radio program until I borrowed radio from one Christian friend. I followed the radio lessons thoroughly and then one day I knelt down with tears in front to Jesus Christ to confess my sin and to accept Him that He is my only savior seven years ago. Right on the moment I felt something removed from me and filled with peace and happiness. This all are the work of Holy Spirit. I thank you. You taught me and others to accept Jesus Christ as our redeemer.
