## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Please pray that the Romanians will understand the Bible as Dr. McGee explains it. Romania has a great need to turn to God.   

  

Pray for the secular FM stations that air TTB-Romanian, that they will be diligent in airing all episodes. Please pray also for an increasing number of listeners and spiritual impact.  

  

Praise the Lord that some missionaries decided to help new converts to grow using CDs of TTB. Please pray that more missionaries will do the same.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Ghilad, Romania:** I discovered your frequency a few years ago and every night I listen with a special joy and pleasure to each Thru the Bible program. Pastor Sorin Covaci has a special wisdom and he is enlightened by the Holy Spirit to present the gospel to us. This program is my daily “spiritual” food. I want so much to have these messages on MP3, so I will be able to listen every time I want to. I want to study the Bible and to learn more about God. I wanted to raise some money and I tried for a few years, but I haven’t been able to do it. Therefore, I am asking you if is possible to send me the CDs for free. **From Mehedinti, Romania:** I am so happy that I was able to be a small part of your ministry by distributing some solar radios in my village. I am glad that these people received these radios because they didn’t have any other possibility to listen to God’s Word. Many of them have no electricity in their houses. I thank you in the name of Jesus for this opportunity. **From a prisoner in Torino, Italy:** First, I want to thank God for you and for your wonderful work that you do for your listeners. I listen every night with joy and I feel blessed. I am 29 years old and I am in Italy in prison since 2006 and I’ll stay here for a few years, but I am happy because the Lord Jesus is here with me. I am so grateful that God forgave me and gave me the assurance of my salvation. I’ve made a written request to get the permission to be baptized here. There is an Italian pastor who is allowed to visit me. I have a large family in Romania, 8 brothers and sisters, but only my mother received the Lord Jesus in her heart. Therefore, I need your help if possible. Can you call her and tell her to listen to your programs? I can’t talk to them in Romania, because I am not allowed to call on a cellphone from here. I still miss my family but my biggest joy is that I know that my sins are forgiven and I feel free even if I am incarcerated. I listen every night to your programs and I read the Bible. The Lord offers me encouragement through His Word and through your messages. The TTB program explains the Word of God so good so anyone can understand it. I’ve seen a great need among people everywhere and that is the need of a better understanding of the Bible.
