## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Praise God that production of our new TTB-Hmong programs is progressing well. A number of books of the Bible have been produced and are being made available to the Hmong. Already the programs are becoming very popular. Please pray that production will continue to move forward and that hearts will be prepared to hear God’s Word and the good news of salvation through faith in Christ.  

  

Three Vietnamese languages – Hmong, Yao, and Jarai – are being distributed through SD memory cards and speaker boxes to thousands of listeners. Many of these hungry souls join together in groups to learn the Word of God. Please pray for them.  

  

Pray for the on-going translation and production work of our Hmong producers. They live and work in a very difficult and spiritually oppressive environment. Ask for God’s blessing and protection as they translate Dr. McGee’s messages into their heart language.   

  

Pray for the FEBC leaders who are building and expanding the content delivery system that will allow the Hmong listeners to grow deeper in their faith.  

  

There are an estimated 350,000 Hmong in Vietnam who have turned to Christ in just the past few decades. Some missiologists have called this one of the most significant mass conversions among a people group in the past quarter century. Credible reports of entire villages putting their faith in Christ are common among those who travel to the remote areas where many Hmong live. Much of this evangelism has been accomplished through the broadcasts of FEBC in the Hmong language. But now, with so many new believers, there is a great need to ground them in the Word of God. Some believers have very little access to Bibles and systematic teaching of the Word of God. FEBC has asked us to work with them to bring Thru The Bible to the Hmong so they can grow deep and strong in their knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
