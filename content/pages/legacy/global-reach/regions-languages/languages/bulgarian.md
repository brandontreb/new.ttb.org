## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Our Bulgarian team requests prayer for a spiritual awakening in Bulgaria, where people are becoming more and more indifferent to Christianity. Pray that TTB would be an effective missionary tool for reaching the unsaved and a source of biblical education among believers who need to grow in their faith.  

               

Many of our listeners in Central Europe are facing instability and financial hardship in their circumstances. Ask the Lord to use the TTB broadcasts to deepen their trust in God.  

  

Many of the countries of Central Europe suffered for decades under Communist rule. While increasing levels of freedom have come to many people in this part of Europe, many of these countries have a long road of recovery ahead of them as they continue to face the devastating effects of atheistic Communism. Pray for open ears and minds and that the Holy Spirit would soften hearts to accept God’s gift of salvation through grace.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Brestovica, Bulgaria:** I am writing to you to thank you for the Thru the Bible program. This program has greatly touched my life. In my village I and the other believers are listening to your radio programs. These programs have been the only source of the gospel for us. **From Svoge, Bulgaria:** Because of your program, I understood about God’s truth and about Jesus Christ. I received the faith in Jesus with great conviction. These 30 minutes are very insufficient for my big desire to learn more from the Bible.  **From Byala Reka, Bulgaria:** Let me say that this is a very good program! I am so encouraged each time I listen. With God’s Word as my guide, my life has changed for the better, and it is all because of your teachings. I am always grateful to God and to you for helping me so much in my walk with Christ.  **From Sandanski, Bulgaria:** I would like to thank you sincerely for this wonderful radio program. Your programs have been such a blessing to me all these years. The numerous CDs you sent me I distributed to all my friends and relatives. Let God bless you and multiply your strength so that the listeners will be able to believe in God’s Word!
