## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Doh Marcel Monjou, our African French producer, has been suffering from a problem with one of his eyes, and doctors are now saying he will probably lose all of his sight in that one eye. The ministry of this brother in Christ has a huge impact across West Africa. Pray that God will continue to use him in a mighty way and that, despite this infirmity, he will be able to rest in His eternal promises.  

               

Please pray for peace and stability in Mali where earlier this year the democratically-elected president was overthrown by a military coup. TTB has a ministry into this country in the French (African), Bambara, and Pulaar languages.  

  

For the church in the Ivory Coast to take a lead in bringing reconciliation. Pray for refugees – especially children – who are fleeing the country scared, vulnerable, and often alone. Praise God the production and airing of programs continues.   

  

A praise from the director of TWR-Burundi: “TTB-French (African) is finally on air in Burundi on the university radio station, the Voice of Hope…. We see this as an answer to our prayer of seeing French-speaking communities in Burundi and across the borders (Congo and Rwanda) reached with the gospel of Jesus Christ!”  

  

Please pray that God would both guide and provide as we consider additional ministry opportunities to the people of Africa. There is a great need for sound Bible instruction. If it’s in God’s will to increase TTB’s African ministry, we want to be obedient and faithful in doing so!


## Listener Testimonials



**From Côte d’Ivoire:** After having followed the programs I chose to become a child of God. I see that my life changes completely. Your message upset me. I see that I was driven like a beast without intelligence. Pray for me so that I can grow in the faith and that I am faithful to the Lord. **From Côte d’Ivoire:** I come to understand truly that it is from Satan I must flee; I resist him in the name of Christ Jesus. Doctor, your words give me in Christ new strength to continue my walk with Jesus. **From Benin:** I marveled because through the broadcast of the day on Maranatha radio that you present, I have just understood that God the Father is very near to me, that He doesn’t sleep and that He listens to the one that pays attention to His voice. If I want to be in relation with God, that with sincerity I look for it. I have joy to tell you that it is true. When I prayed, He heard me. It convinces me. I became Christian. Pray for me so that I can continue. **Received via SMS:** I have received the call of God. I hardened my heart because I prefer to do other things. I was in that situation when yesterday night, you spoke to me as if the Lord entered my bedroom to tell me: “Why do you want to go the way of Jonah? Can you agree to live his experience?” Thus I understood. When I repent, I feel peace in my heart, for henceforth I answer “yes” to the call of God. I can’t help telling you this testimony. You have helped me choose the right way. Glory to God.
