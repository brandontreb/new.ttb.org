## Praise and Prayer Needs


 The UN is reporting that “up to 2,000 Somali refugees cross into Ethiopia each day. Thousands also seek refuge in neighboring Kenya.” Aid agencies are appealing for tens of millions of dollars in emergency funding to fight a drought that has created a triangle of hunger where the borders of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia meet. Please remember this situation in your prayers – that the TTB programs in Swahili, Amharic, Oromo, and Somali will bring a message of hope to those who are suffering so much during this terrible drought and famine.  

  

Please pray that God would both guide and provide as we consider additional ministry opportunities to the people of Africa. There is a great need for sound Bible instruction. If it’s in God’s will to increase TTB’s African ministry, we want to be obedient and faithful in doing so!


## Listener Testimonials



**Phone message from a listener in Ethiopia:** TTB is my school that I attend every evening to learn the Bible. The way you teach is very simple to catch the course and to understand your explanation. I and my friends form a Bible study group of four members. Our reference for the Bible study is your daily course. So, our group gathers every evening at my room to listen to TTB. I and my friends have a plan to add more members in the group by inviting friends and some other individuals, especially those who don’t have an opportunity to hear about Christianity. Pray for me.  **From Ethiopia:** I learned from Bible study by radio that leading a Christian life is not just going to church on every Sunday. If we start to live a Christlike life we might face hardships like persecution, harassment, torture, beatings, etc. However, we can defeat the challenges by the help of Jesus Christ. I faced many challenges when I became the true follower of Jesus Christ, motivated by your radio programs. The first challenge was from my own family. Since I became a regular and active listener to your radio programs my character has been changed and my family learned that I became a Christian. Because of this, they hated me. Although they hated me, I didn’t stop telling them the truth: That if they listen to the TTB radio program they will love it and it will change their lives as it did mine and at the same time they will be saved. Now they are not opposing listening to your radio programs, so I am sure that one day they will join the Kingdom of God. So brothers and sisters please pray for my parents. **From Ethiopia:** I am very happy about the TTB radio program. It is winning many souls for the kingdom of God. I am one of these who was saved through this radio ministry. Since I became your regular listener, I became free from the bondage of self-condemnation, from bitterness, from blaming others. Praise to Jesus. Now I am free from hatred, especially from hating Christian brothers and sisters. God used your program and saved me. Still today, although Satan never stopped to worry me, I will never go back to such a horrible life. Jesus Christ is my Savior. Holy Spirit also protects me from falling into Satan’s trap. With the help of the Holy Ghost I continue to live a victorious life over demons. I love Jesus Christ. I love you and your radio program. God bless you. **From Ethiopia: ​**I was especially encouraged by your daily radio programs. This is a heavenly voice and treasure for me. Through your radio programs God has called me back to serve Him in prayer. Now my life is changed and I am better acquainted with the Chief Shepherd every day, and the information you are sending on air has been helping tremendously. I am promoting and distributing the news about your radio programs to my villagers and others. I believe that as you and we are praying together we grow in trust and unity.
