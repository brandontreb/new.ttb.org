## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Chhattisgarh:** I listen to the program in my own language regularly and I am blessed by the Word of God. I belong to a different faith and I always thought that Jesus Christ was a God only for Christians. But after listening to your messages, I know that Jesus is the savior for all humankind. He died for our sins. Now I too believe in Him and I have accepted Him as my personal Lord and Savior. I read the Bible and pray every day. Your program helps me grow in the Word of God. Please pray for my spiritual growth. Thanks for your letters and literature that you sent. My family does not believe in Jesus; so please pray for them. I believe that one day they will come to the Lord. **From Chhattisgarh:** My wife and I work as labourers to meet the needs of our family. We have three children. We listen to the program regularly. I came to know the true God through your program. I belong to a different faith. I would worship idols and live in sin. I had no hope. But Jesus changed all that. Your program changed my life – bringing joy, peace, and hope into it. I have now accepted the Lord Jesus Christ and surrendered my life into His mighty hands. I thank Pastor Pradeep Kumar, the speaker of the program, who came to my house and encouraged me with the Word of God. The program is a source of spiritual food and so it is a blessing to me. I now read the Bible and pray to the Lord daily. Now that I have the living God, I have stopped worshipping idols. I trust the Lord and I know that He will lead and guide me in the days to come. Please pray for my whole family. We all believe in Jesus and follow His teachings. Thank you so much for your love and concern for my family. **From Chhattisgarh:** I am a college student and a regular listener of your program. I belong to a Christian family but I was not living a life pleasing to God. One day your message touched me to the core and I repented for all my sins and accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. Please pray for me that I may grow in Him. **From Chhattisgarh:** I am a farmer and I belong to a non-Christian family. I came to the Lord after listening to your radio program. I was searching the truth since many years and found it only through your broadcast. I thank God for your wonderful program which helps me to understand His Word and His love for mankind. I believe in Jesus Christ and have accepted Him as my personal Lord and Savior. I also share about Him and His gospel to many people. Please pray for me and my family and also kindly send one Bible to me.
