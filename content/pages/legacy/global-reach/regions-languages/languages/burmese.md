## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Please pray that TTB taught in the Burmese language will facilitate deeper biblical knowledge for the church in Myanmar, so that people may have a better understanding of the assurance of salvation.  

  

TWR was recently contacted by a small group of immigrants from Myanmar now living in Buffalo, New York. They don’t have a trained pastor or teacher to lead them, but the gentleman heading up the group remembered listening to the TTB programs while living in Myanmar. They plan to start using the TTB Burmese and Karen programs for their times of worship together. Please pray for the Lord’s provision and encouragement for this small group of believers who have a desire to learn more about God’s Word in their heart language.  

               

Pray for the people of Myanmar, the vast majority of whom live in poverty (2/3 of their children are malnourished and most people survive on less than $1 a day). Pray that despite their physical destitution, they would discover the wealth of joy, peace, and spiritual fulfillment that is found in faith in Jesus Christ.  

  

Pray for the protection of our producer and his team as well as for true religious freedom in Myanmar. Some Christian minorities suffer discrimination and persecution at the hands of the military.  

  

Pray that the TTB program will touch the hearts and minds of Buddhists and that many would come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Myanmar:** When I heard biblical messages presented by [our TTB-Burmese producer] they are new and strange to me. Sometimes I have to prepare tea for visitors and I couldn’t listen to TWR-Myanmar radio. However, the visitors had the opportunity to listen to TWR radio programs and they benefited spiritual strength. To listen to TWR-radio programs is very precious for me because when I was asked to exhort at church, I told them about the messages related to Bible presented by TWR-Myanmar. **From Myanmar:** As we don’t know the Bible, we don’t know its meaning. We are Buddhists. We come to know the meaning of the Bible only when teachers explain it to us. Furthermore, is it true that the prophets’ prophecies and the things in the Bible are fulfilled? Is last days approaching already? I am also illiterate and had to ask other people to write for me.  **Our production team reported having received this phone call from a listener:** He called TWR-Myanmar saying that he could not write and so he called before going to the front line. He said that he listens to Thru The Bible of TWR-Myanmar broadcast whenever he is free. He asked whether TWR-Myanmar received his letter or not. “Pray for me as I am in a battle field. I try to share messages of God’s Bible to other compatriots in my unit. However, they do not seem to take seriously as Christians.” **From Myanmar:** This month I not only benefited spiritual strength but also my knowledge on Bible increased because you presented about Jonah in detail in this month. Pray for the farmers in our village because rain had ruined the [crop]. We are also distressed by the rain. We also prayed. Believers rely only on God.
