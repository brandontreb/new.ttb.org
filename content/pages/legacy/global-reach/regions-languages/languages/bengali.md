## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Kolkata, West Bengal:** Ever since I accepted Jesus as my personal Lord and Saviour, I have been regularly listening to the program. It happened about three years ago. My daughter was very sick and my family and I were worried sick. But because of our prayers God healed her, quite miraculously. I never stop thanking Him now; as a result I am growing spiritually. Your radio program is like a light in my pathetic life. It helps me to be strong in times of difficulty or suffering. It leads me in the right direction and guides my behavior. Please pray for me. I thank God for the assurance of salvation.  

  

**From Kolkata, West Bengal:** There was a time when my life was terrible. I admit that I sinned greatly. But when I started listening to the program, gradually God disciplined me and I have turned away from the path of destruction. I became a new person as I started praying regularly. And God helped me. Today I live a peaceful life and everybody loves me. I believe that I belong to Jesus. Pray for me and my family and that I continue to live with His grace.  

 **From East Midnapur, West Bengal:** I have been listening to the program since five years. Every morning at 4:00 AM I eagerly wait for the same. I am very much blessed by your program as my life has been completely changed by the Word of God. My family also joins me in listening to the broadcast and is spiritually blessed. Please pray for me.  

  

**From Patra Midnapur, West Bengal:** I am a regular listener of the program. It continues to be a source of blessing for my daily living. Where I live there are no Christians/believers and that is why I constantly tell my relatives and friends about Jesus Christ. For doing this I receive encouragement from the Word of God. Please pray for me as it is my heart’s desire to bring many more in my village to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.  

  

**From Medak, Andhra Pradesh:** We were idol worshipers since our ancestral times. There were many deities present in our home and we used to follow them faithfully. Even then we never had peace in our lives. One day accidentally, we happened to listen to your Bible messages and gradually hearing the same we came to learn many good spiritual lessons for our lives. As a family we became regular listeners of your program and kept receiving great exhortations through it. Very soon we came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and at personal level I dedicated my life for doing Lord’s ministry. As a gift from TWR I received an SD Card with the Banjara programs and a player. Whenever I play it I invite my neighbors to join me and listen to your program. I have so far formed two groups where I play the SD card and in this way my Banjara people are able to hear God’s Word and are coming to His saving knowledge. I praise God for delivering me and my family and many other people from our community from the clutches of superstitious beliefs and idol worship. Kindly pray for all of us.
