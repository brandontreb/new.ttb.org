## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Tamil Nadu:** Like Mary sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to His words, we also sit near the radio every day to listen eagerly to [TTB-Tamil]. We praise God for the blessings we receive. Every day the Lord wakes us early in the morning and teaches us His wonders and the deep truths leading us into a closer walk with Him. **From Tamil Nadu:** I am one among the many who are listening to the Bible study on a regular basis. I was born and brought up in a family of another faith. Since 2008 I have been listening to your program. Gradually I came to know about the Lord Jesus Christ. I could understand what salvation is and I have accepted the Lord as my personal Saviour. Nowadays I am listening to the study from the book of Revelation. It helps me to know about the second coming of the Lord. **From Tamil Nadu:** I am blessed by your Bible study programmes. I am maturing in my spiritual life. Every study is beneficial for me. I praise God for the wonderful explanation you have given for the book of Revelation. I understand that the devil can tempt us only after getting the permission from the Lord. It was encouraging to know that the Lord will protect us even in our journey in the wilderness. **From Tamil Nadu:** Now we are listening to the studies from the book of Revelation and they are very useful to us. If I ever happened to miss the program, I feel as though I have not eaten that day. One day I was very sad and discouraged but while I was listening to the program I felt as if God himself was talking to me and He helped me to understand the situation and also gave me the strength to go through my sorrow. Praise the Lord!
