## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for Brazil’s 190 million Portuguese-speaking people and for the many ethnic people groups to come to know Jesus Christ and to grow in their walk with Him.  

  

Please pray for our many listeners throughout Latin America, that the program would be an effective tool in reaching them. 


## Listener Testimonials



**Email from a listener in Brazil:** I have been studying with [you] for more than three years. I hear the program on my lunch break and it is a wonderful time with God. God speaks to my heart through this study in many ways! May we continue steadfast, because I want to keep this habit until the return of our Lord Jesus! Glory to God for this ministry, and may God continue to bless you richly and all listeners too! **From Brazil:** You work very hard to preach the precious Word of God. I am an assiduous listener of the Thru the Bible program and I give my testimony, saying that this program has blessed me a lot and has helped to increase my faith. Because of that, I just have to say thank you very much to God for preparing this program to bless many lives around the world.  **From Bahia, Brazil:** I’m listening to this wonderful program that teaches us the genuine Word of God, because the explanation is very clear. I ask you to continue helping me in prayer, because I believe that prayer of the righteous is powerful in its effects. Many people and I in my family are donors, for the goodness of God, of this so valuable work. **From Brazil:** I want to congratulate you because you serve God in this wonderful work that has been helping us in spiritual growth through Bible courses, studying the books of the Holy Scriptures with the program Thru the Bible. I thank you from my heart. When I have moments of spiritual warfare I get strength and confidence through the words of comfort and with the messages and illustrations that come to us from the studies. Keep up the good work breaking boundaries, preaching the gospel of salvation, and I think many people like me are delighted and amazed with everything the Lord has given us through this ministry. **From Angola:** I accepted Christ at 18, and then heard almost every day the program Thru the Bible, being encouraged, consoled and exhorted. I could not hear for a few years. But today I am happy, listening to internet programs from the book of Daniel. Now we are in Genesis 16. May God continue blessing you, giving grace to continue this work. May you reap the blessings of God.
