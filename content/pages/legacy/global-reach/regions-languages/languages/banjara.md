## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Pray for the distribution of TTB programs on Secure Digital (SD) cards in the Banjara and Gondi languages in India. Pray that God will lead TWR to the right partners to form home listening groups among these populations.  

  

Pray for the hundreds of home listening groups meeting across India to listen to TTB together.  

  

Several of our Indian producers, their spouses, children, or production team members are suffering from serious or chronic health problems. Please pray that it would be the will of our Great Physician for them to be healed, and in the cases where that is not possible pray for strength, perseverance, and comfort – both physical and spiritual – in their suffering.  

  

Alcohol abuse is a common problem in many parts of India. Pray that believers would come under personal conviction of this sin and turn their backs on it. Among those who are unsaved, pray that they will turn to faith in God, who is the only one who can provide the peace and comfort they seek.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Andhra Pradesh:** Through the SD card player, we listen to your program. Listening to the messages on it we have come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and have left all the idol worship practices of our previous faith. We receive great peace in our hearts only through your program. We do not know how to read and write but still are able to get good knowledge for our lives through it. Kindly pray for us. **Our production team reported this testimony from Andhra Pradesh:** Married to a lady from a different religious background, Mangya encountered various difficulties. He felt that faith and values went together and given her religious background and belief in rituals they couldn’t seem to agree on anything. The SD card player that TWR presented to him was a Godsend. When he first played the messages, Mangya’s wife ignored them. But gradually, the messages touched her heart and she developed faith in the living God. Today the couple plays the program regularly for the people in their village. What a joy it is for them to see the enthusiasm of their community to hear God’s Word. They were introduced to the living God and it made them happy. If for any reason Mangya is unable to play the program, many from the village enquire about them, revealing their interest. **From Andhra Pradesh:** Thanks for your prayerful replies to my letters. Six years ago I was working as a school teacher. After my marriage, I thought I was barren as I did not conceive immediately. Naturally disappointed, my husband remarried and went away to Saudi Arabia. I was in deep sorrow. I could not believe that I could have no child. Nothing seemed to ease the pain I felt. A few weeks after my husband left, I happened to listen to your program. I took down the phone number and called you, requesting you to pray for me. After your encouraging letter, I committed my life to Jesus. God rewarded me and I was blessed with a boy child. How impatient my husband was. Now I live happily with my little boy. Your prayers and concern are a source of encouragement. Though my husband abandoned me, Jesus was with me. He blessed me with a son. He cares for me. I am thankful to Jesus who wiped away my tears. **From Andhra Pradesh:** In our community, there are about 60 families and all of them own a radio. When as a family we listen to your program some of these families also join us and listen to your teachings. Slowly the number of people has started increasing and now there about 20 families who listen to your broadcast and have come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. Praise the Lord. **From Andhra Pradesh:** Through the SD card player, we listen to your program. Listening to the messages on it we have come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and have left all the idol worship practices of our previous faith. We receive great peace in our hearts only through your program. We do not know to read and write but still are able to get good knowledge for our lives through it. Kindly pray for us.
