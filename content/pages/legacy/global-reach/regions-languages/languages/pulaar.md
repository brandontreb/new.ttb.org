## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Please pray for the situation in Nigeria, where the persecution and killing of Christians by Muslims continues to take place. Horrific stories are coming out of the Plateau State where TTB broadcasts in the local languages of Hausa and Yoruba. We also have a ministry to the nomadic Fulani people (who are responsible for many of these killings) in the Pular language through the distribution of media players, but most of this work is being done in Mali, which is also a hotbed of recent Christian persecution. Many of our brothers and sisters in Christ throughout West Africa endure horrible suffering on a daily basis and many have lost their lives because of their faith. Please pray for believers there and for a peaceful resolution to the violence.  

  

For the Saber/MP3 ministry ‚Äì in the Pular language in Mali and Tswa in Mozambique ‚Äì that listening devices will be successfully distributed and that the programs will be effective in educating rural pastors, encouraging believers who have no access to churches, and bringing lost souls to Christ.  

  

Please pray for peace and stability in Mali where earlier this year the democratically-elected president was overthrown by a military coup. TTB has a ministry into this country in the French (African), Bambara, and Pular languages.  

  

Please pray that God would both guide and provide as we consider additional ministry opportunities to the people of Africa. There is a great need for sound Bible instruction. If it‚Äôs in God‚Äôs will to increase TTB‚Äôs African ministry, we want to be obedient and faithful in doing so!


## Listener Testimonials



*In many parts of the world illiteracy, lack of access to forms of communication, exorbitant postage costs, or even cultures hostile to Christianity prevent listeners from contacting us. In those cases we receive little to no direct feedback from listeners. Please pray especially for the production and outreach teams working on these languages, as it can be very discouraging to not receive communication in response to your hard work. Pray that God would grant them assurance in their hearts that their work for Him is not in vain. Pray also for the listeners, that they would be ministered to by the Holy Spirit in a life-changing way despite not being able to connect with us personally.*
