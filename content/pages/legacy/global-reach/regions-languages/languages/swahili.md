## Praise and Prayer Needs


 The UN is reporting that “up to 2,000 Somali refugees cross into Ethiopia each day. Thousands also seek refuge in neighboring Kenya.” Aid agencies are appealing for tens of millions of dollars in emergency funding to fight a drought that has created a triangle of hunger where the borders of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia meet. Please remember this situation in your prayers – that the TTB programs in Swahili, Amharic, Oromo, and Somali will bring a message of hope to those who are suffering so much during this terrible drought and famine.  

  

Please pray for those involved in our ministries in Nigeria and Kenya, as well as the local churches there that have increasingly come under attack by local Muslim extremists.  

  

Please pray that God would both guide and provide as we consider additional ministry opportunities to the people of Africa. There is a great need for sound Bible instruction. If it’s in God’s will to increase TTB’s African ministry, we want to be obedient and faithful in doing so!


## Listener Testimonials



**From Kenya:** I greet you in the name of Jesus. I would like to thank you for your encouraging letter and a book that has changed my life. I was struggling with my life not knowing that Christ died for me that I may be redeemed from sins. Since I gave my life to Jesus two months ago and started listening to your program and writing to you I have found peace in my heart. God bless you for the good work. Send me more literature. **From Kenya:** I visited a friend of mine who introduced me to your program and gave me literature that you sent him. I have been listening to this program and I have learned a lot of God’s Word and even praying more than I used to pray. I was just a Christian and not born again. I received the gift of salvation and now it is like I did not understand the Word of God like now. Keep the good work for the glory of God. **From Tanzania:** I came across your station when I was doing my housework. I stopped what I was doing to listen to the teacher of the Word who was very clear and explained the Word in a simple way. From that day I have never stopped listening to you and that is why I decided to call you. It was nice talking to you on the phone and thank you for the literature you have promised me in advance. **From Busia, Uganda:** We are receiving your program loud and clear. I thank you for your teaching of the Word of God. I will write to you when I get a stamp. God bless you. **From Kenya:** Pray for my family’s salvation. I am the only one saved and we have a lot of conflict in the family. It is my prayer that we all give our lives to Jesus.
