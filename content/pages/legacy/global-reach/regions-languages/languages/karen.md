## Praise and Prayer Needs


 TWR was recently contacted by a small group of immigrants from Myanmar now living in Buffalo, New York. They don’t have a trained pastor or teacher to lead them, but the gentleman heading up the group remembered listening to the TTB programs while living in Myanmar. They plan to start using the TTB Burmese and Karen programs for their times of worship together. Please pray for the Lord’s provision and encouragement for this small group of believers who have a desire to learn more about God’s Word in their heart language.  

               

Pray for the people of Myanmar, the vast majority of whom live in poverty (2/3 of their children are malnourished and most people survive on less than $1 a day). Pray that despite their physical destitution, they would discover the wealth of joy, peace, and spiritual fulfillment that is found in faith in Jesus Christ.  

  

Pray for the protection of our producer and his team as well as for true religious freedom in Myanmar. Some Christian minorities suffer discrimination and persecution at the hands of the military.  

  

Pray that the TTB program will touch the hearts and minds of Buddhists and that many would come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.


## Listener Testimonials



**From Myanmar:** I had been listening to TWR-broadcast at least 8 or 9 yrs. The reasons why I listen to TWR-Myanmar is that I received much spiritual strength and to understand about Christ more accurately; to be able to go to heaven when I die; I benefited biblical and secular knowledge; I enjoyed listening to TTB and other radio programs of TWR-Myanmar broadcast. **From Myanmar:** First of all may God shower His blessings upon all abundantly! I am so thankful to you for your reply, and encouragement. I received spiritual strength and peace of mind by your words of encouragement and advice. I need prayer as I am growing old and start to feel pain which adults usually suffer and my physical and spiritual strength are deteriorating. Due to your encouragement, I regain spiritual strength and peace of mind to understand and to admonish my young grandchild who is not good. I am thankful to you all for praying for my grandchild. I am so thankful to TWR-Myanmar for broadcasting radio programs related to God by means of radio. **From Myanmar:** I received spiritual strength and peace for hearing the purpose and meaning of each verse of Proverbs full and complete through Karen Thru The Bible. I also come to know more about Bible.
