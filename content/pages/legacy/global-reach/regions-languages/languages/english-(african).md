## Praise and Prayer Needs


 Please pray that God would both guide and provide as we consider additional ministry opportunities to the people of Africa. There is a great need for sound Bible instruction. If it’s in God’s will to increase TTB’s African ministry, we want to be obedient and faithful in doing so!


## Listener Testimonials



**From Tanzania:** Praise be to God! It is my pleasure to take this time to write to you and express my thanks for the way you have been a great help to my spiritual growth. I continue to listen to your teachings through one of the FM radios here in the city. The programmes are such a great blessing to me and my family. I also tell my friends to take the time to listen to your programmes. Thanks also for the Bible notes and outlines by Dr. J. Vernon McGee which you have been sending me. May God bless you so much for the effort in spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ. **From South Africa:** I listen to Dr. McGee’s programme and am very blessed. We have formed a women’s group with new Christians from abused and broken homes, also some non-believers, widows, etc. Can I please have your books on Luke and Deuteronomy? Keep up the good work. **From South Hills, South Africa:** Dear friends in the Lord. I want to thank you very much for your interest and care and the letter you sent me with advice from the late Dr. J. Vernon McGee which I appreciate so much. I cannot tell you how excited I was to receive all the literature and it has helped me a lot to clarify some questions to which I had no answers. I can only thank the Lord for what He is doing through TWR. Also the radio broadcasts are teaching so many people now in different countries, speaking different languages, having different needs, but all needing a Saviour in our Precious Lord! God has done mighty things in your midst! So my prayer is to keep you faithful and obedient to Him. If we can listen to TWR we do not go hungry concerning the Word of God. May the Lord Jesus Christ be very close to each worker of TWR and glorify Him in these challenging days! **From Harare, Zimbabwe:** May you kindly send me Dr. J. Vernon McGee’s notes and outlines? Currently we are studying the book of Mark. Thank you for the Thru the Bible programme. I started listening to the programme twenty years ago. I have grown in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Keep up the good work you are doing for the Lord. **From Kwa-Dlangezwa, South Africa:** Thank you very much for sharing the Good News with us. Here in my area many still struggle to know the truth about the Holy Scriptures and their so-called pastors and leaders have not undergone any biblical training. That is why mixing scripture is prevalent here where I live. Poverty is also a major factor. There is a church I attend who allow me to share with them the Good News. Young people in the church have already started asking me questions about ancestral worship since this church was started by some with clairvoyance abilities and a lot of that is still happening! Your material helps me in teaching and helping the young people in my church. **From Mzimba, Malawi:** I got your address from a Bible you sent to this remote area where I live. I prayed and started studying it and my desires were totally fulfilled. I discovered that the only way is to be honest with the gospel, repent before Christ, and obey the leading of the Holy Spirit. The Lord is so wonderful! He called me out of Roman Catholicism. I was a Roman Catholic priest for a length of time. I believe now that I am a new creature as I have left the false doctrine. I would rather be poor, I miss my vehicle and good food but I have gained everlasting life!! Jesus is my personal Saviour! His precious blood has cleansed all my sins. Please, can you send us Bibles? I want to reach more lost souls. I anticipate hearing from you soon.
