description: "Thru the Bible with Dr. J. Vernon McGee - Taking the whole Word to the whole world"

We all have a list of questions we'd like to ask a trusted teacher or counselor. For decades, people wrote Dr. McGee their questions that he then answered on a program called, *Questions and Answers.* In his brief yet rich responses, Dr. McGee untied the knots around some of the most frequently asked questions about faith, life, morality, and the world around us. 


Dr. McGee’s *Questions & Answers* program is widely available online below, or check with your local ****Christian radio station to see if it may****air [in your area](https://ttb.org/programs/find-a-station)****.****
