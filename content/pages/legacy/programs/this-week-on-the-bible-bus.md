## The Bible Bus is on the road again through the whole Word of God, and we have a seat saved for you.


Don’t be shy—say hello to your [fellow passengers](http://www.ttb.org/biblebus) and get acquainted with all the [great resources](https://www.ttb.org/resources). You’re riding with people from all over the globe who also love the Lord and His Word, and we travel together to some great places. Let’s ask God to lead our journey—teaching us His Word, guiding us into grace and truth, loving us through every mile.

P.S. Look for something extra to help you in your walk in the Word each week, too!
