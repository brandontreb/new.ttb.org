Jump on the Bible Bus every weekday and in five years, you'll have studied the entire Bible. We alternate in our study between first an Old Testament book and then a New Testament book, then back to the Old Testament, etc. As Dr. McGee tells us, this pattern illustrates common themes and glimpses of God at work through history . . . and also in our lives. You can hop on board this Bible Bus anytime. Find out where we're studying today from our [Bible Reading Schedule](https://ttb.org/programs/bible-reading-schedule).
