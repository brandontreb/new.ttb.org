God’s Word tells us to “let the word of Christ dwell in you richly” (Colossians 3:16)—meaning, let Scripture soak in your mind and your thoughts. If you want to get the most from our Bible study together, spend a few minutes in God’s Word before you listen. Read and ponder that day’s Scripture passage. Let it soak in your thinking. You’ll very likely discover more when you later study that passage with Dr. McGee. Or perhaps you’re reading through the Bible at your own pace. Use this tool to chart your progress and keep you on track.
