 Praying Micah 7:7 as we travel the Ivory Coast


November 01, 2017




*“Therefore I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me.”* -Micah 7:7 


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today our journey through Africa continues as a listener in the Ivory Coast asks for our prayer.


*“God has used your programs to deliver me and help me make important decisions in my life. I* *used to rush ahead of God and make bad decisions. I was listening only to my fleshy desires and the advice of ungodly friends. As a result, I’ve had several failed marriages and children with different mothers. Listening to your broadcasts has corrected my heart and I only want to listen to God from now on. I often repeat Micah 7:7 to myself as a reminder to wait on the Lord and hope that He will bring peace with many people I have hurt. Please pray for me.”*


Today let’s thank God for His work in our lives and ask that He would give us the strength and patience to wait and hope in Him.


**We’re heading southwest tomorrow as we travel on our knees to Mozambique. Meet us there.**
