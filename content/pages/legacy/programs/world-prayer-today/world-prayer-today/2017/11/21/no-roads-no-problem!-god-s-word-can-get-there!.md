 No roads? No problem! God’s Word can get there!


November 21, 2017




As the World Prayer Team travels through Ethiopia today, we join this listener in praising God for His goodness:


*“I live in a very remote area where there is no electricity, roads, or infrastructure. I tune into your program in the evening and it comforts and strengthens my soul. Neighbors around me often ask me to turn up my radio, so they too can benefit from your Bible teachings. We are simple people, but we are overwhelmed by the thought that the God of the universe cares enough to send us a message in our own language. At least seven other villagers are now saved. Please keep up the good work.”*


God is faithful! As we rejoice in the saved lives of these listeners, let’s ask Him to multiply the ministry of His Word in Ethiopia and around the world.


**Invite a friend to join us as we praise God in Paraguay tomorrow.**
