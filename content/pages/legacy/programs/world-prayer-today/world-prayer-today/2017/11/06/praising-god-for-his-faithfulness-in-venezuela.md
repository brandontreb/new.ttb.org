 Praising God for His faithfulness in Venezuela


November 06, 2017




*“Your faithfulness endures to all generations;* *You established the earth, and it abides.” -*Psalm 119:90


*“Welcome to* *Piedras de Perijá, my little corner of Venezuela!”*


That’s what a listener named Helena writes. She continues:


*“I was 13 when I first heard this program, and now I am 57. I rejoice in the Lord for the tremendous seed He has sown throughout my life. This teaching and the stories of God’s faithfulness in our family have been passed from generation to generation as my grandchildren now listen as well. May God allow you to continue with this great work. I bless you in the name of Jesus Christ.”*


What a wonderful letter! Today let’s praise God for the seeds He is sowing in our lives, too, and pray for God’s powerful hand to be upon not only our children but future generations as well. 


**Pack your bags and travel with us tomorrow as we pray our way through Chile.**
