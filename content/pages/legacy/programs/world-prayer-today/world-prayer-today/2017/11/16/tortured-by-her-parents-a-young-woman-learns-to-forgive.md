 Tortured by her parents, a young woman learns to forgive


November 16, 2017




Often persecuted by animists and extremist Hindu groups, Christians in the Indian state of Tripura need our prayers. As one listener recently wrote:


*“My parents are very strong in their beliefs. So when I came to Christ they began to torture me and eventually threw me out of the house. I was desperate, but a friend invited me to live with her. While I was there, we began to listen to your programs.* 


*“I was weak, but through your teaching, I became strong in my faith. I now belong to a church and am talking with my parents again. They haven’t accepted my faith, but now when I visit I listen to your programs and they do not stop me. Please pray God will break down their hardened hearts.”*


Praise God for the bold faith of this young woman. Today let’s join her and pray for her parents and everyone who hears *Thru the Bible* in the Kok Borok language. Ask God to work in their lives and bring them into a saving relationship with His Son, Jesus. 


**Tomorrow we pray alongside a brother in Madhya Pradesh who writes, *“There are very few Christians in our village and no church, but that didn’t stop God from finding me.”***
