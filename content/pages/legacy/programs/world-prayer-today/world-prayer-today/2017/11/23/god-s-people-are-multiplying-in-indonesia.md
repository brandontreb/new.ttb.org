 God’s people are multiplying in Indonesia


November 23, 2017




In this special season, we’re celebrating the miraculous way God is at work honoring our prayer requests. Join us as we praise God for countless people who, like this family in Indonesia, are coming to faith in Jesus Christ through the broadcasting of His Word.


*“My family and I have believed and received Jesus through your teaching. It started as two of us, but now we are five! We are very grateful for Sundanese broadcasts that strengthen our faith. As new believers we understand little, but the program helps us to know Jesus more.”*


As we praise God for His Word in Indonesia and around the world, let’s also remember to thank Him for the work He is doing in our lives as well. 


**Keep praying that more listeners will hear God’s Word and respond in faith, and join us back here tomorrow as we travel on our knees to Egypt.**
