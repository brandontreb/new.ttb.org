 Praying in one of the poorest countries on earth


November 09, 2017




Matthew 5:3-6 says, “*Blessed are the poor in spirit,* *for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.”*


That’s what we’re praising God for today as we lift up His people in Haiti, one of the poorest nations on earth.


As we make our way through *Port-au-Prince*, read this update from Storly Michel, *Thru the Bible’s* Creole producer.


*“Recent promotions of the Creole broadcasts are working! We’re experiencing a dramatic increase in the number of online downloads. Pray that as more people realize these programs are available, that our numbers will continue to grow. Pray also that visitors to the* *[website](http://http://ttb.twr.org/creole)* *will encourage their friends and relatives in Haiti to become regular listeners of the radio programs.”*


Isn’t that good news? As we honor Storly’s request, let’s also ask God to meet the desperate physical needs of listeners in Haiti as they come to a relationship with Him.


**Tomorrow we’re praying our way through Colombia. Invite a friend to join us at** **[TTB.org/pray](http://www.TTB.org/pray)****.**
