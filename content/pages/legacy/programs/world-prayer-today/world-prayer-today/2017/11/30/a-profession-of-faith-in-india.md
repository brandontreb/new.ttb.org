 A profession of faith in India


November 30, 2017




*“That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”* -Romans 10:9


Salvation through Jesus Christ. That’s what we celebrate today and every day as we travel the world on our knees. Listen to the story of this fellow Bible Bus passenger in West Bengal, India, who heard Romans 10:9 and took it to heart.


*“I worshipped many gods and lived a quiet life. But one day I turned on the radio and heard your program and everything turned upside down.* 


*“At first, I listened because I liked the music, then I began to listen to the teaching. I was surprised by what I heard and what surprised me more is that it began to sound reasonable. The idea that a God could love me was different than anything I had heard before. Slowly my faith in Jesus Christ increased and I stopped worshipping other gods.* 


*“Then I heard your program on Romans 10:9. That night I cried before the Lord, repented of my sins and accepted Him as my personal Lord and Savior. I am now growing daily as I listen to your program. My wife and children have also chosen to believe. We have many friends and neighbors who oppose our decision, but we choose to trust the Lord and invite them to listen to your programs with us.”*


**Be encouraged, World Prayer Team—and keep praying! There’s more to celebrate tomorrow, we’ll meet you here.**
