 “I persecuted my children when they chose to believe in the Lord …”


November 28, 2017




Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today as we pray our way through one of the last Communist countries in the world, we stop and hear the surprising story of a mother who first asked the Lord for His forgiveness and then her children. 


*“I gladly listen to your program every evening in Vietnam. The Word of God has touched my heart and I am a new person. I was a sinner … the worst kind of sinner. I persecuted my children when they chose to believe in the Lord. When I realized my error, I first asked the Lord to forgive me and to accept me as His child. Then I came before my children and asked their forgiveness too. It is hard for a mother to humble herself in front of children, but I was embarrassed of my old ways and wanted to become a true Christian. I am grateful that God has accepted me for who I am and that my children are willing to forgive me, even though I once rejected them.”*


**We’ll be praising God and sharing more great stories of restoration and redemption in the coming days on World Prayer Today. Join us on your knees.**
