 1 billion people, 95% unreached


November 29, 2017




*“But Jesus looked at them and said to them, ‘With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.’” -*Matthew 19:26 


That’s what experts tell us about the country of India: One billion people, 95% of them unreached with the Good News of Jesus Christ. But despite the overwhelming task of taking His whole Word to India, we know nothing is impossible for God.


Welcome to World Prayer Today where we’re praising God for the faith of a listener named Ritu in the Indian state of Assam. Here’s his story:


*“I was brought up worshipping idols, but I wasn’t very religious. I spent my days as a laborer in a tea garden. At night, I often filled my life with worldly pleasures. I drank a lot and quarreled with others and I didn’t spend much time with my wife or son.*


*“One night instead of drinking, I went to visit an old friend. While I was there, we listened to your radio program. The teaching was something I had never heard before. I thought it was strange, but I also felt a peace that I never known before.* 


*“It’s been two months since that visit and I’ve listened to you every night. I have accepted Jesus as my personal Savior, and I have been baptized. Since I have changed so much, my wife now listens to the program with me. She wants to know more about God. Please pray that we will be a family united in Christ. That as we follow His Word we will have peace in our home.”*


That’s a great request! As we praise God for Ritu’s faith, let’s also pray God’s Word will open the eyes of others who are ready to listen.
