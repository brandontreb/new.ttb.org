 From the Middle East: “I’m falling in love with the Bible!”


November 20, 2017




Praise and celebration—that’s our goal for the rest of the year here on World Prayer Today. So, join us today as we rejoice in the new life of Hiba, a listener in the Middle East.


*“I’m falling in love with the Bible. Your explanations and introductions to each book are amazing. I always considered the Bible as holy, but thought it highly impractical and irrelevant for our times. Now, after listening on a regular basis I have found it is a treasure—full of wisdom and answers for my life. I’ve recently understood why Jesus died on the cross and come to love Him. Today I prayed that He would be my Lord.”*


God is doing great things around the world and through our intercession, and we get to be part of it. 


**Join us tomorrow as we praise and thank Him for His work in Ethiopia.**
