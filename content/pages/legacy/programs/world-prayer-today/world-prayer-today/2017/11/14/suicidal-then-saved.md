 Suicidal then saved


November 14, 2017




*“Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.”* -1 Peter 5:6, 7


 


Welcome to Uttar Pradesh where today we have the privilege of meeting a listener of our Hindi broadcasts. He writes:


*“Growing up my family belonged to another faith. We were extremely poor and life was hard. As I came into adulthood, I became a farmer and it was difficult for me to provide enough food for my family. I was depressed and one day tried to commit suicide. As I was recovering a neighbor gave me his radio and told me to listen to your programs. It was the first time I had heard the name of Jesus and it changed my life. I began listening every day.*


*“Soon it became apparent to everyone around me that God had filled me with joy. When they asked me what had changed, I recited 1 Peter 5:7 to them and told them I no longer have a need to worry. My family now belongs to a church and we are regularly able to share the love of Christ with others! To God be the glory for His grace in our lives. May others around the world receive it too.”*


Yes, may all those in Uttar Pradesh (also known as the home of Hinduism) hear His name and believe! As they come in faith to Jesus Christ for salvation, let’s pray they too experience His care and provision in their lives. 


**Tomorrow our prayer journey takes us to Maharashtra. See you there!**
