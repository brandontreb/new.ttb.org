 “The drugs I was taking were killing me. I was close to death.”


November 27, 2017




*“The drugs I was taking were killing me. I was close to death.”*


That’s the beginning of a beautiful redemption story we hear from a listener in South Africa. He continues, 


*“I grew up in a Christian family but I failed to choose the right friends. After completing grade twelve, I decided to do things my own way. My parents did everything to bring me back, but it was difficult for me to stop. I ended up living on the streets, until I found a shelter that accepted kids. One day while I was there waiting for food, the security officer was listening to your teachings from his mobile phone. I asked him to turn up the volume so I could listen too. In my language of Zulu, I heard your message about the God of the second chance. I looked at myself and I thought there was no way I could receive a second chance.* 


*“That’s when I began to get sick. I was thin and coughing a lot. Someone at the shelter finally convinced me to go to the hospital where I was diagnosed with tuberculosis. While I was treated, I heard your broadcasts again! I cried and thought to myself that maybe it was time for me to change. That’s when I asked a nurse to contact my family. I found them and repented. Shortly after, I received Jesus as my Lord and Savior.* 


*“I am writing to tell you that you saved my life through those teachings. It sounds dramatic, but it’s true. I now listen regularly and am growing in my faith.* 


*“May the Lord bless you and please keep the fire burning. Because you brought my life back together, I am sure you will do the same for other young people out there.”*


Praise God for the second chance He gives us all!
