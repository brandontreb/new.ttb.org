 “Our boat got stranded at sea …”


November 15, 2017




*“You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.”* -Exodus 20:4


*“The day I heard you talk about Exodus 20:4 is the day that changed my life.”*


That’s the good news we hear from a listener in Maharashtra, India, on World Prayer Today. He continues:


*“I grew up in a family that worshipped idols. As a fisherman, I also worshipped the sea. I had never heard God’s Word before but that verse awakened my heart. I threw out the relics of my old beliefs, I stopped smoking, and I began to listen regularly … but my wife refused to join me.* 


*“One day our boat got stranded at sea and we didn’t come home for days. My wife became desperate with worry. On the second day she turned on the radio for company. That’s when God’s Word took her heart as well. When I came home she greeted me with tears of joy for my return and also for her salvation in the Lord.* 


*“Since those early years, our family has had many joys and many trials. The grave illness of a child, financial difficulties, and daily weariness of life; but we have never gone back to our idols and old rituals and blind beliefs. God’s Word was planted in our hearts and we have stood witness for Him. Our children now stand with us as well. Please pray for us. We invite others to listen to your broadcasts. Since the beginning more than 130 have been baptized in Jesus’ name.”*


It is for people like this that we pray every day! Be encouraged and keep praying as the Word of God touches people’s lives all around the world.
