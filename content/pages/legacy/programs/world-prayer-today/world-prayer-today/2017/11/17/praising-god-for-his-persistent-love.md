 Praising God for His persistent love


November 17, 2017




*“There are very few Christians in our village and no church, but that didn’t stop God from finding me.”*


That’s the incredible news we hear from a listener of our Bhili broadcast in Madhya Pradesh, India. Here’s the rest of his story: 


*“We were very poor and there was no peace in our home. My wife miscarried several times and I began to worry. I visited village priests, practiced witchcraft, offered roosters and goats at the temple. Nothing changed. We were miserable.*


*“One night I turned on my radio and heard a person talking about God. I was so surprised and I continued to listen. On that very day I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior and Lord. I was overcome with peace and others began to see a change in me. At first my wife and parents opposed me … but they were no match for my new love for the Lord. Slowly, they also accepted the Lord. Over the years my wife and I have been faithful to God’s Word and decided to trust Him with everything we have. Would you believe it? When we thought we wouldn’t be able to have a child, God has brought us three! It was in His time and His way through our surrendered hearts.* 


*“We just want to tell you how grateful we are for these messages that have* *given us a new perspective on life; we now think differently. We continue to share your teachings with others in our village and pray that the Lord will stop at nothing to capture their attention as He did mine.”*


Praise God for His persistent love! Today let’s pray that each man, woman, and child in Madhya Pradesh will hear of Jesus and receive His mercy and forgiveness. 


**There’s more to praise God for next week as we travel on our knees across the globe.**
