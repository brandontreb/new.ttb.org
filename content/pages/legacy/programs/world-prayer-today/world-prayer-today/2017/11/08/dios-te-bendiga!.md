 “Dios te bendiga!”


November 08, 2017




*“Dios te bendiga”* (God bless you) is a common greeting we hear over and over again as we walk the streets of Tegucigalpa, Honduras.


Welcome, World Prayer Team! Today we’re interceding for the warm and gracious locals, like Iris, who says:


*“We are poor and life has been hard. I was working and we still didn’t have enough to eat. I became tired and depressed. I felt there was no hope. Hearing of my troubles, someone in my village came to visit me and brought a radio. Together we listened to your program. Now I visit her regularly so I can listen more. I have realized that God was there all along and that He used my depression for a great purpose … to bring me to Him! I want to thank you for your great support in my life. I love you in Christ.”*


Praise God that He can use every circumstance in our lives to bring us closer to Him! Today let’s pray more people in Honduras will hear His Word and realize His unending love and grace in their lives.


**We’re praying for another impoverished nation tomorrow—join us in Haiti.**
