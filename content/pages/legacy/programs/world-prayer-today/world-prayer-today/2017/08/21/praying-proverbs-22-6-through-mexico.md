 Praying Proverbs 22:6 through Mexico


August 21, 2017




### *“Train up a child in the way he should go,* *and when he is old he will not depart from it.”* - Proverbs 22:6.


*“I grew up in the city of Juarez and recall listening to your programs with my father.”* That’s the opening of an email from Luz who listens to our Spanish broadcasts in Toluca, Mexico. She continues:


*“Over the years we moved and I lost touch with your broadcasts. But I praise God that three years ago He put it on my heart to find you on the Internet. Each day at 6:30 AM I sit down with my husband and children (six years old and nine years old) and we listen on my cell phone.* 


*“The Word of God keeps me alive spiritually and physically, it sustains me in the face of every challenge that comes to me day after day. I pray that as my father passed on this tradition to me, that I also will pass this on to my children. The ability to know and understand God’s Word is more precious to me than anything else.”*


Praise God for parents who make the worship of God and the study of His Word a priority in their lives and within their families. Let’s pray that God’s Word will take root and blossom in little hearts and minds in Mexico and around the world.


**God is at work in Guatemala! We’ll join together again tomorrow on World Prayer Today to get the details.**
