 “How I have come to love the Word of God!”


August 01, 2017




### *“…At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”*  -Philippians 2:10, 11


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today as we travel through the United States, we stop to pray Philippians 2:10 and 11 with Silvia, who listens to our Spanish broadcasts. She says:


*“I started this trip on the Bible Bus recently and words cannot express the blessing that it has been. Oh, how I have come to love the Word of God! Besides the emotion that I feel when I realize again the deep love our Lord has for us, the knowledge I receive from your clear exposition is helping me live my life in ways that are pleasing to Him.*


*“I pray that God continues to use you to reach thousands in every language and every nation so that everyone who hears His Word will confess that Jesus is Lord! I will continue to ask the Lord to cover your every need in His abundance and greet you with the peace of our Savior Jesus Christ.”*


That’s a great request of the Lord! Let’s echo Silvia and ask God to save all those who hear His Word on *Thru the Bible.* May people from every tribe and every nation confess that Jesus is Lord!


**Tomorrow we’re off to Quebec, Canada. Hop aboard and pray with us!**
