 “The Word of God gives our people hope.”


August 07, 2017




### Interesting, mystical, and often misunderstood. That’s how many people describe the Romani people.


Welcome to World Prayer Today. Our journey brings us to Romania where we meet with Cirpaci, a pastor who asks us to pray for his Romani congregation:


*“I encourage my congregation to listen to your programs. Many are poor but gather together around a common radio to listen. The Word of God gives them hope. Our people are often hated by others, so knowing God loves them is a big shift in their thinking. Please pray that God’s Spirit will transform them as they hear His Word!”*


What a great request. Today let’s join Cirpaci in that prayer. And while we’re on our knees, ask God to use *Thru the Bible* broadcasts to minister hope to the millions of Romani who feel rejected and devalued by society. May they realize that God loves them and gave His Son for them. 


**Join us tomorrow as we pray and praise our way through Albania.**
