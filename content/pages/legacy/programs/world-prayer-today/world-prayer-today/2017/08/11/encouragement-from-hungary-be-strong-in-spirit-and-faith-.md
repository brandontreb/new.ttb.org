## 
 Encouragement from Hungary: “Be strong in spirit and faith.”


August 11, 2017




### *“Be strong in spirit and in faith. I would like to meet you and be with you in eternal glory!”*


That’s the encouragement we receive from a listener of our Hungarian broadcasts. He continues:


*“I listen to* Thru the Bible *every evening and it strengthens me in my body and in my soul. I haven’t got words to thank you for this grace! I am the oldest person in my church, but I am still around. Although I am tired, I will praise God until He calls me to glory. I will pray you will do the same.”*


What great encouragement! Today let’s pray Psalm 119: 28 for all *Thru the Bible* listeners: Although our souls melt from heaviness, may He strengthen us according to His Word.


**Next week, we’ll be traveling on our knees through Africa. Meet us on Monday in Malawi.**
