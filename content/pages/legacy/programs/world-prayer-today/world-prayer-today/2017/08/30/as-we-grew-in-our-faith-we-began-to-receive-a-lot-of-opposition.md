 “As we grew in our faith, we began to receive a lot of opposition …”


August 30, 2017




### *“We worshipped many other gods, but we are grateful for your program that introduced us to the true Lord, Jesus.”*


That’s what we hear from a father in Chhattisgarh, India, on World Prayer Today. His story continues:


*“My name is Mahadev and I am 45 years old. My wife, my three children, and I live in a small village. I sell fish in the marketplace to pay our bills. I come from a non-Christian family, but in 2014 I started listening to your Chhattisgarhi program.* 


*“Slowly your teachings motivated my heart and influenced my life. The Word of God in my life has made a great impact. One day while I was listening, I heard Acts 4:12 that says, ‘Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.’ Those words were a turning point in my life. I repented from my sins and accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal Savior.* 


*“That’s when I threw away any portrait or sculpture of other gods in our house and began to share my faith with my wife and kids. As we grew in our faith, we faced a lot of problems, specifically we started getting opposition from our family and friends. But we are holding strong. We’ve even joined a local church.*


*“Thank you so much for your teaching that is very easy to understand. And I mostly thank the Lord Jesus Christ that He died for our sin on the cross. Please continue to pray for our family. It is not easy to follow the Lord here.”*


God is answering our prayers for India—please keep interceding!
