 A Dutch broadcast in Latin America?


August 25, 2017




### A Dutch broadcast in South America? That’s the question many people asked with surprise when *Thru the Bible* began airing in Suriname.


That’s why today we’re praising God for the good results we are seeing in the hearts and lives of people in this former Dutch colony. Although our target audience is primarily the Muslim Suriname-Javanese people group, let’s join together in praying that all people in Suriname will hear about the love of God that’s revealed in His Word. 


**Our journey of prayer and praise continues next week in South Asia. We look forward to traveling with you.**
