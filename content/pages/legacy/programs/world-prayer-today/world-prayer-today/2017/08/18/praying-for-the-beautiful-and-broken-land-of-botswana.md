 Praying for the beautiful and broken land of Botswana


August 18, 2017




### Beautiful but broken. That’s how many people describe the AIDS-ravaged country of Botswana. But praise God, His Word is bringing hope to listeners like this one named Sasha.


*“I have gone through so much trauma from this disease that I began to feel only deadness in my heart. A few months ago, I moved to an area where I heard your programs and am beginning to have a bit of hope for my future. You are encouraging me to change my view of myself by looking at myself through God’s eyes. Please pray that in time I may have the strength to do this.”*


Like the country itself, let’s pray for all the beautiful, broken people in Botswana. May God’s Word give them strength for today and hope for a glorious future with Him.


**On Monday our prayer journey takes us to Mexico where we’re reminded to pray for the minds and hearts of the little ones in our lives.**
