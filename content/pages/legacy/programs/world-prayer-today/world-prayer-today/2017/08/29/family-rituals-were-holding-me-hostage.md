 “Family rituals were holding me hostage”


August 29, 2017




### *“I started listening to your programs and now I preach the Word to others.”*


That’s the good news we hear from a listener of our Konkani program in Karnataka, India, today. Here’s the rest of his story.


*“I praise and thank God for your program that reaches out to people with His Living Word. I was depressed, but learned through your program that the wicked one was using my family rituals to attack me and hold me hostage. Now I use your programs to mold and shape my life. I have learned this from your daily teaching and have never been happier. Through your program I get the strength and courage to preach to others. Please pray that God will use me for His purpose. It is my heart’s desire to minister to my people. There are so many that don’t know Him and need freedom from the religion of their ancestors. I pray that I might reach just one.”*


Praise God for the heart of this listener and hometown missionaries like him. Today let’s ask God to bless the efforts of this listener and all those who want to share the freedom found in our Lord Jesus Christ with their countrymen.


**God is at work in India! Join us tomorrow as we hear how Acts 4:12 changed the lives of a family in Chhattisgarh, India.**
