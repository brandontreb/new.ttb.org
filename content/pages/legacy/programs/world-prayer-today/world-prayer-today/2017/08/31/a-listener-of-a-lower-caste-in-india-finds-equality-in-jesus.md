 A listener of a lower caste in India finds equality in Jesus


August 31, 2017




### *“Then Peter opened his mouth and said: ‘In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality. But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him.’”*  -Acts 10:34, 35


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we travel through Jharkhand, India, and sit with a listener of our Maithili broadcasts who shares his story:


*“It is the joy of my life to have found your program. Coming from a lower caste family, I thought I was not created to even pray to God but always to be considered more unimportant than everyone else. Through your program, Jesus has changed all of that. I now feel accepted and truly aware of who I am as a child of God. Your Bible study programs have made me into a real man, a changed man. It has been over ten years that I have listened to your radio programs, and I am grateful for each one.”*


Thank the Lord for His Word that breaks down barriers. Today let’s pray that more people in India realize their importance as children of God. May they be changed by the inheritance they receive as God’s children.


**There’s more good news from India. Join us tomorrow in Maharashtra as we pray for listeners of our Deccani broadcast.**
