## 
 A desperate father requests our prayers


August 16, 2017




### *“Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”*  -Romans 15:13.


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we stop in Guinea Bissau and pray with a family that is battling cancer.


*“I am a father of two children. My wife has cancer and is undergoing treatment in another country. I’m often desperate about the situation and feel hopeless. Please pray for my wife and for our family. Your programs have helped me a lot in these times of family crisis. I need to know that God is near.”*


It’s likely someone you know and love is battling illness, too. As you pray for them today, will you remember this father and all our fellow listeners who are dealing with life-threatening illnesses? Through His Word, may God provide them with hope and encouragement in their most desperate moments of doubt and fear.


**Tomorrow our journey through Africa continues in Mali. Meet us there.**
