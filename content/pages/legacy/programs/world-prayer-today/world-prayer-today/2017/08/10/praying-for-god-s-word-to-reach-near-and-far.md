 Praying for God’s Word to reach near and far


August 10, 2017




### Psalm 63:3 says, *“Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise You.”*


That’s also what we hear from a listener of our Bulgarian broadcasts. She writes:


*“God’s lovingkindness is overwhelming. In our small village, we receive your broadcasts and are growing in our faith. There is no church, no pastor, but our numbers are growing. We are simple people, and your messages make sense to us. We always praise God for His faithfulness and pray that your broadcasts will reach others both near and far.”* 


Like these brothers and sisters in Bulgaria, may we too praise God for His lovingkindness in our lives. And let’s join them in praying that’s God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* will reach those in Bulgaria and around the world.


**Our prayers for God’s whole Word to reach His whole world continue tomorrow in Hungary. Join us, won’t you?**
