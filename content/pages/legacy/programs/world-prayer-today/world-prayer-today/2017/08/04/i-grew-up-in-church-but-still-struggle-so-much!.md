 “I grew up in church but still struggle so much!”


August 04, 2017




### *“I grew up in church, but I still struggle so much!”*


That’s what Adam, a listener in Tennessee, recently shared. He continues:


*“I don’t always understand what God is doing, but I continue to pray and read my Bible. I was very happy when I found and downloaded your app. Now I read a chapter of the Bible each morning while I get ready for work and then listen to Dr. McGee on my commute to work. I love the app! I’m learning so much and slowly my questions are being answered. Thank you in Jesus’ name.”*


What an honest letter. Let’s pray that more of God’s people in the United States and around the world will make Bible study a consistent part of their daily lives. Through their time in His Word, may God reveal Himself to them and deepen their faith. 


**Next week we’ll pray our way through Central Europe. Meet us in Romania on Monday.**
