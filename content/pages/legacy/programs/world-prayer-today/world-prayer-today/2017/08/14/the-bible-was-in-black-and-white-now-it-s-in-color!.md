 “The Bible was in black and white, now it’s in color!”


August 14, 2017




### Do you remember how you felt that first time you studied God’s Word and what was once difficult to understand began to make perfect sense?


An excited listener in Malawi describes her recent experience:


*“It is as if everything in the Bible was in black and white, and now it’s in color! Your teaching in the book of Daniel has given me spiritual glasses! The Spirit has used you to open my eyes and my heart! I can now see what God was doing in Daniel’s life as well as mine. Please send me any notes you have for your programs. I want to know everything God has taught in this amazing book, the Bible!”*


Praise God! As you pray today, please ask the Lord to open the eyes of more listeners in Malawi. Through His Word, may His glory be revealed.


**Join us tomorrow for another story of God’s goodness—this time in Madagascar.**
