 What are you learning as you study God’s Word?


August 17, 2017




### What are you learning as we study God’s Word together?


A listener in Mali, Africa, recently sent us this reply to that question:


*“I came to know the Lord through your Bambara language programs and have listened since that time. Recently, the study of chapter three of First John touched me and taught me the importance of putting the Word of God into practice. I now understand that if we obey the commands of God that means we love God. I have also come to realize the heart that does not love is not obedient. If I love God, I must accept all that comes from Him and obey. I am trying to put this into practice.”*


Praise God for these wonderful lessons that He teaches us as we study His Word. And like this listener, let’s pray that more in Mali will hear God Word’s on *Thru the Bible* and respond in faith.


What’s God teaching you as we study His Word together? We’d love to hear your story. Send us an email at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#490b202b252c0b3c3a091d1d0b67263b2e).


**Then be sure to join us tomorrow as we pray for the beautiful but broken land of Botswana.**
