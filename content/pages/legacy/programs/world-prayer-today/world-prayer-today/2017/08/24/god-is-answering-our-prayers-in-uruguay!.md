 God is answering our prayers in Uruguay!


August 24, 2017




### “The Switzerland of South America.” Because of its long history of independence and democracy, that’s what many call the country of Uruguay.


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we travel to one of the most stable economic and political countries in South America, but sadly it’s also known as one of the most secular nations in Latin America.


Yet there is good news, too. Despite the very liberal social laws and the estimated 17 percent of the people who claim to be atheists or agnostic, God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* is making inroads. Let’s celebrate this letter from Santiago.


*“My dear brothers in Christ!* *My joy is so great every time I hear your programs. I was an agnostic, but eight months ago a Jehovah’s Witness visited my home to share his religion. I had misgivings about what he was saying, so I began to look for answers. The more I looked, the more I became concerned about my eternal future.*


*“My worry ultimately led me to the Word of God. That is when I found your program. I am so grateful that you have introduced me to our Lord Jesus. I have now accepted Him as my Savior! I am confident my future is in secure hands. What a relief!* 


*“I have heard it said that God works in mysterious ways. I am so grateful in my case that He did. Sincere thanks for everything and may God continue to bless abundantly each of you who work so hard to make these programs possible as well as those who support it in prayer.”*


Yes! Thank you, World Prayer Team for your faithful intercession. God is answering our requests. Keep asking the Lord to use His Word to change hearts in Uruguay. 


**Tomorrow we’ll praise God for the good results we’re seeing in the hearts and lives of people in a former Dutch colony. Join us!**
