 “I listen on my cell phone anywhere and whenever I feel like it.”


August 02, 2017




### *“I listen on my cell phone anywhere and whenever I feel like it.”*


That’s what we hear from a listener of *Thru the Bible’s* French broadcasts in Quebec. He continues, 


*“I just finished listening to the commentary on Zechariah and, frankly, I have to say that it is fantastic. There is so much to learn. I’ve never understood the Bible in this way before. I have the privilege of being able to listen to the broadcasts on my cell phone anywhere and whenever I feel like it. Thank you for making this possible.”*


Praise God that His Word is accessible in more than 120 languages on *Thru the Bible*. With each broadcast, let’s ask that He bring many more listeners into a saving relationship with His Son, Jesus. 


**Our prayer journey continues tomorrow in Los Angeles, California. Grab your sunscreen and sunglasses and meet us there.**
