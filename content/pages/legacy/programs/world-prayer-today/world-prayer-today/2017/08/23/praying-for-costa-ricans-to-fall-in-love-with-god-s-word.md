 Praying for Costa Ricans to fall in love with God’s Word


August 23, 2017




### Beautiful rain forests and hot springs heated by underground streams of molten lava …. There is so much beauty to enjoy today as our world prayer trek brings us to Costa Rica.


While we slow down and enjoy the view, let’s remember to look up and pray for a couple of the pressing needs of Costa Ricans (also known as “Ticos”) including:


* the more than 16% percent of locals who live in poverty, and
* the social and economic stress caused by hundreds of thousands of refugees coming to Costa Rica from Nicaragua.


While we ask God to meet these physical needs, let’s also ask Him to meet people’s spiritual needs. May more Ticos come to know and love Him better as they study His Word.


**God is answering our prayers in Uruguay! Learn about it tomorrow right here on World Prayer Today.**
