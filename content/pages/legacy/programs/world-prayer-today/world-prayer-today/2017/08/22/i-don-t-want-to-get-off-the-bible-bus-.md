 “I don’t want to get off the Bible Bus.”


August 22, 2017




### *“I don’t want to get off the Bible Bus.”*


That’s what we hear from a listener named Francisco in Guatemala. He continues:


*“I hop on every day. As we stop in each book, I observe with amazement and joy every detail of the Word of God. Its riches fill me in ways I never imagined. I have shared this program with my friends and although at first they are too busy or proud, a few have begun to listen regularly. I pray that the broadcasts you send do not stop and that people in my country will receive the Lord.”*


Let’s join Francisco in asking God to bless the broadcasting of His Word in Guatemala today. Pray that those who are listening will humble themselves and open their hearts to Jesus.


**Costa Rica is our prayer destination for tomorrow. Join us as we pray for God to meet the physical and spiritual needs of people there.**
