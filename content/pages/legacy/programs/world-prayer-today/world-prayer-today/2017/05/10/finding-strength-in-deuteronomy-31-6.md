 Finding strength in Deuteronomy 31:6


May 10, 2017




*Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the Lord your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you.*  -Deuteronomy 31:6


That’s the verse that one listener in Punjab, India, is clinging to today. Here’s her story:


*“I live in a small village and was born into a non-Christian family. They were not happy when I accepted Christ. For many years, I was lonely and losing touch with my faith, but your radio program came to my rescue. It is now my manna and because of your program, I am now even more in love with Christ than ever. When my family gives me a hard time about being a Christian, I love to read Deuteronomy 31:6. I recently shared your program with my friend, and she is now a believer. Through your program and the faith of my friend, God is definitely showing me that He is with me and will not forsake me. I thank you for your blessed presence in my life. You are like family now.”*


Today, let’s praise God that He will never forsake any of us! And let’s ask Him to continue to bless the teaching of His Word in Punjabi so that more people will hear of Jesus and believe.
