 A listener in the Philippines requests our prayers


May 25, 2017




### *“My life is lonely.”*


That’s the beginning of a text we received recently from a listener of our Tagalog broadcasts in the Philippines. She then requested our prayers: 


*“My husband died one month ago. Please pray that this feeling of despair will be lessened and that I can recover from this tragedy. Pray that God will give me the courage to accept the reality of life, stand up, and move on in this life. I am badly in need of your prayers.”*


God hears us when we pray. Today let’s intercede for this woman and all *Thru the Bible* listeners who are brokenhearted. May God be near them as they mourn and make His presence known. 


**We’re headed to the gorgeous Solomon Islands tomorrow. Pack your bags, we’ll meet you there.**
