 “May the peace of the Lord be with each of you”


May 31, 2017




### Welcome, travelers! Today our journey brings us to the quiet and stable country of Gabon, where we meet with a listener who tells us what God’s Word is teaching him.


*“I’m a security guard, and during my night shift duties I enjoy listening to* Thru the Bible*. I’m always assured of God’s protection because, as I listen, your programs give me confidence that God is with me. My favorite verse is John 14:27 when Jesus says,‘Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.’ It calms me and keeps me focused on Jesus even when things are unknown. Please pray that I may grow spiritually, and I will pray that the peace of Lord be with each of you.”*


If you are troubled or afraid today, find peace in John 14:27. And as you praise God for this wonderful reminder in your life, please pray that God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* will bring peace to the hearts of all those who hear it. 


**Tomorrow we’re headed to wildly beautiful Kenya. Pray with us here at [TTB.org/pray](http://www.TTB.org).**
