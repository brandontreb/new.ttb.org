## 
 Praising God in the middle of our suffering


May 17, 2017




### In Romans 8:18 Paul says, *“For* *I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.”*


Those are the words a listener named Nadia in Croatia is clinging to today. She tells us:


*“I can’t begin to describe the great joy I feel since I am now able to hear every word in your program. I cannot go to church because I am ill and cannot leave my bed. But hearing the Word of God feeds my soul. You’ve helped me understand so much in your programs; things seem much clearer to me now! When I am sad and lonely, I remember Paul’s suffering and realize that God has bigger, more important plans for me. So I am using this time to get to know Him better and hope that I can soon share His Word with others. As I study His Word, my every need is met. My heart and mind are being transformed as I wait on Him. I give Him all the glory and praise for what He is doing in my life.”*


What a wonderful reminder that even in our weakness and infirmities God is with us! As we bow our heads today, let’s follow Nadia’s lead and give Him all the thanks and glory for what He is doing in our lives! 


**Our journey through Central Europe continues tomorrow in Romania.**
