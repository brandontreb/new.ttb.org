## 
 A daily dose of inspiration


May 03, 2017




### *“We give God all the glory, honor, and praise.”*


That’s what a grandmother named Renee from North Carolina recently wrote to us. She continues. 


*“I have been a listener since early 90’s while I was driving home working nights. Twelve years ago, our only grandson was born 17 weeks early. He defied overwhelming odds at birth, and continues to defy the odds today. Although his difficulties and impairments are many, his life continues to speak of God’s everlasting love and grace. Every day at lunch he listens to Dr. McGee with his nurse, and recently his home teacher asked what he wanted to be when he grew up. As he typed, his answer was clear and concise: ‘When I grow up I want to be a preacher!’ Thank you for providing sound biblical principles, giving us hope and inspiring us all to be a part of the Great Commission.”*


Do you know someone who needs the inspiration to serve God despite their difficulties? As you pray for them, will you also pray for those listening to *Thru the Bible* who need to hear that message as well? Let’s ask God to give them the courage and like Renee’s grandson, may they seek to serve Him in amazing ways.


**Tomorrow our journey continues in Reno, Nevada. Hop aboard and join us!**
