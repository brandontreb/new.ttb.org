 “There is nowhere like the broad shoulders of Jesus on which to place our troubles.”


May 30, 2017




### *“I tried to forget my troubles, to close my eyes and turn my back … but they always returned.”*


Welcome to Burkina Faso, where God’s Word is bringing comfort and hope to listeners like this one. She continues:


*“That’s when a friend introduced me to your programs in my language of Bambara. When we began our study together in Hebrews, I was touched with each message. The idea that I can find rest in God has relieved me. Since I have learned to rely on Jesus, I am quiet even though all my problems are before me. I no longer try to ignore them because I know that Jesus carries them for me. At the appointed time, He finds solutions. I pray others will find this rest as well. There is nowhere like the broad shoulders of Jesus on which to place our troubles.”*


Isn’t that a beautiful word picture? Do you or someone you know need Jesus to carry your burdens, too? Let’s take this listener’s advice and give them all to Him. Pray that more people will learn to rely on Jesus in their times of trouble and need.


**There’s more to pray about in Africa tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
