 Pray for God’s Word in Romania


May 18, 2017




### Welcome, World Prayer travelers! Today we stop in Romania where God’s Word is encouraging a group of believers to meet and pray together.


*“We are from a village in Cluj. We are a small community of believers and we do not have a pastor. We are so glad that we can hear this program every evening. We are learning a lot as we study God’s Word. From time to time we get together in somebody’s home and talk about things from the Word of God. We pray that as we live our lives for God, that more people will join us.”*


What a great request. Let’s join them in praying for more people in their village and across Romania to hear *Thru the Bible* and begin to study God’s Word. And while we’re at it, let’s pray for *Thru the Bible*’s Romanian producer, Sorin Covaci. Let’s ask God to use each message for His glory and to reveal His great love and grace to everyone who listens.


**Join us tomorrow as we pray our way through the Czech Republic.**
