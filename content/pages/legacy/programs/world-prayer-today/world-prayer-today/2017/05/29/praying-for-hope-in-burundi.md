 Praying for hope in Burundi


May 29, 2017




### Today’s stop on our world prayer tour brings us to the African nation of Burundi, where we’re praying for *Thru the Bible’s* broadcasts in the Kirundi language.


In a country of nearly nine million, the majority of people in Burundi live in extreme poverty. Experts estimate that more than 45% of Burundi children are malnourished and thousands suffer from AIDS and malaria. Please pray that God’s Word will bring hope and joy to people who desperately need it. 


Let’s also intercede today for the physical strength, spiritual discernment, and endurance of Eliud Mbazumutima—our producer of the Kirundi broadcasts. Ask God to use each message for His glory and to reveal His great love and grace to everyone who listens.


**Thank you for your prayers and your partnership! Join us tomorrow as we travel to Burkina Faso.**
