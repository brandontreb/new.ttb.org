 “Rituals consumed our lives”


May 08, 2017




### *“Rituals consumed our lives ….”*


That’s what we hear today from a listener in Assam, India. But his story doesn’t stop there:


*“One day my mother fell ill and we could not find a cure. We were despondent. That’s when a Christian friend we knew began to share his faith and tell us about Jesus. His kind actions and care for our family surprised us all. We began to join him in prayer and my mother began to get better. After a while our friend invited us to listen to your programs. We loved them immediately. Now I listen every day. I am learning as much as I can because I want to become a preacher. Our village does not have many Christians and people desperately need the hope found in Jesus. Please pray for us. My desire is to serve God and build a church so we can worship together.”* 


Isn’t that great? Let’s lift up this young man and all those who are faithfully studying God’s Word in isolated places. Let’s pray that His Spirit will guide their hearts and give them favor as they reach out with the gospel of Jesus Christ.


**Tomorrow we’re headed to the mountain peaks of Nepal. We’ll see you there.**
