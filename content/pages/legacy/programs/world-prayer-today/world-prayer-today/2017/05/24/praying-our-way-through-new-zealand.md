 Praying our way through New Zealand


May 24, 2017




### Romans 10:15 says, *“How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!”*


Welcome to World Prayer Today. As our journey through Southeast Asia continues, we stop and pray for the “beautiful feet”—or, more appropriately, the “beautiful voice”—of Camil Bhuinya, *Thru the Bible’s* Hindi producer.


While many people primarily associate the language of Hindi with India, *Thru the Bible* also shares these broadcasts in countries like New Zealand, Australia, Samoa, Fiji, and Sweden.


So as we pray today, let’s lift up the ministry of Camil and ask God to multiply his efforts for the gospel. Through messages from God’s Word, may more people be lifted out of their darkness and into the light of knowing Jesus. 


**Travel on your knees through the Philippines tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
