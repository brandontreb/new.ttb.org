 Praying for the lost and confused


May 04, 2017




### *In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct**your paths.*  -Proverbs 3:6


Welcome to Reno, Nevada! Today we meet with a listener named Marlinda who shares how God is using His Word to direct her path. 


*“Your program has changed my life. I found myself in a very dark place after ending an abusive relationship. Although I had the foundation of Christ in my life, I was still very lost and confused. I searched the internet looking for a Christian teacher and clicked on Dr. McGee. The first thing I heard was, ‘If you are lost, my friends, I know of a Savior.’ I listened from that day forward and have rededicated my life to the Lord. For the past seven years, I’ve tried to make wiser decisions based on God’s Word and things have gone well.*


*“I want to thank everyone involved in making this program happen every day. Through his passion for God’s Word, Dr. McGee has a way of helping me understand it in new and fresh ways.”* 


Today let’s pray for all those who feel lost and confused. May they turn to our Savior and the wisdom God offers us as we study His Word.
