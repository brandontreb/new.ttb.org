 From fear to faith


May 15, 2017




### Today’s World Prayer journey brings us to Bulgaria where a listener named Dimitur tells of the great work God is doing in his life.


 


*“I was bound by fear for many years. I doubted my wife, my parents, and all my friends. It continued for more than ten years. But since listening to your program, God has freed me and given me a new life. He restored my marriage! I can only thank Him for what He has done for me. My life has changed from fear to faith. God bless you!”*


Are you fearful of something today? Like Dimitur, give your fears to the Lord and let Him provide freedom through His Son. And together let’s ask God to open more hearts and homes in Bulgaria to His Word heard on *Thru the Bible*.


**Tomorrow a listener in Lithuania encourages us with God’s Word; be sure to join us.**
