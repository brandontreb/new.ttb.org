 Joining a listener in Lithuania as she prays through Romans 10:17


May 16, 2017




### Welcome to World Prayer Today. We’re glad you’re joining us as we travel the stunning Baltic coastline to meet with a listener named Svetlana.


*“I like your radio programs. When one keeps hearing God’s Word, then one’s thinking is renewed and growth is happening. It is hard to keep the faith if one stays alone, if one does not read the Bible. ‘For it is written: So, faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ’ (Romans 10:17). But truth can be elusive. With our religious freedom in Lithuania has come many lies and false teaching. True Bible teaching is rare. Thank you for helping us understand the Bible so we can know and find the truth for ourselves.”*


Today let’s praise God for the truth found in His Word. As we intercede for Lithuania, remember Romans 10:17 and pray that wherever God’s truth is heard, more people will come to faith in Him.


**Fasten your seatbelts—tomorrow we’re headed to Croatia.**
