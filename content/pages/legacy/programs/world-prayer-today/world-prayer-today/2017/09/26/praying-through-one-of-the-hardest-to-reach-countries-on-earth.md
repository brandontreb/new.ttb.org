 Praying through one of the hardest to reach countries on earth


September 26, 2017




*“My husband has left me.”* That’s the beginning of a sad letter we received from Leyla, a listener of our Persian broadcasts in Iran. 


She continues:


*“I'm one of your regular listeners. In December 2015, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. But sadly, when my husband found out about my faith, he left the house and has married another woman. Without his financial support, it is very hard for me and my daughters to live. I choose to trust in the Lord, but we really need your prayers.”*


Today let’s lift up Leyla and all those who face rejection and persecution for their faith. May Jesus’ presence be felt in their lives and may He fill their hearts with strength, wisdom, and boldness.
