 A listener in Yemen tells us, “I am curious to know more about Jesus.”


September 25, 2017




*“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.**For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.”* -Matthew 7:7, 8


*“I am curious to know more about Jesus.”* That’s what we recently heard from a young man named Najob in Yemen. He continues:


*“I have heard about Issa* [Jesus]*, but your conversations about Him are different. I would like to know more. Can I receive a Bible please? I’m sending you my address but I'm not sure if I’ll be able to receive it, but can you try please? In Yemen, I can never find one. I’m eager to have the Word of God in my hands to learn more about Jesus’ death, resurrection, and life.”*


Praise God that His Word is being heard in Yemen. With a population of more than 28 million, experts tell us that only a few thousand follow Jesus Christ. So today let’s rejoice in Matthew 7:7, 8 and pray that more people in Yemen will hear God’s Word and begin to sincerely seek Him. 


**Tomorrow our prayer journey takes us to one of the hardest to reach countries on earth. Ready to pray and see what God will do?**
