 Praying for revival in Wales


September 14, 2017




Once known as a land of revival, in recent years Wales has experienced a dramatic spiritual decline. In fact, only 7% of the population attends a weekly religious service.


Welcome to World Prayer Today. As we travel through the castles and countrysides of Wales, we find that many towns and hundreds of villages do not have a single evangelical church. In addition, many Welsh-speaking communities and people have no access to church or the message of Jesus in their own language.


So today let’s pray God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* reaches into more homes in Wales, bringing more people into a life-changing relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ. In fact, let’s do it now.


*Father, thank You for the miracle of salvation that You give to everyone who turns to You in faith. We boldly pray that You will expand* Thru the Bible’s *reach in Wales and through the entire United Kingdom. May those who hear Your Word be drawn into a life-changing relationship with Your Son, Jesus. For it’s in His name we pray, amen.*


**Our journey through Western Europe concludes tomorrow in the Netherlands, come ready to pray!**
