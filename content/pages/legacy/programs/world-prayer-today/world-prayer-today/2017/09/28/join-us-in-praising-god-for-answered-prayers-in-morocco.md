 Join us in praising God for answered prayers in Morocco


September 28, 2017




Welcome, World Prayer Team! Today as we travel through Morocco we’re praising God for answering prayer. Rejoice in this wonderful story of a husband and wife who listen to our Kabyle programs on the Internet:


*“My wife and I are new to the Christian faith. Thank you for your programs that have helped us leave the religion of our country and turn to Christ. When I accepted Jesus as my Lord, my family was not happy. My father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, my parents-in-law—all denounced me. Only my wife felt the peace I received from Jesus and followed me. They tried to divert her from me, but she defended me. I praise the Lord for her faith. Although we have given up a lot, we have gained everything by our Lord Jesus!”*


God is good! As we thank Him for this new brother and sister in Christ, let’s keep praying that more people in Morocco will hear the Good News and respond in faith as well.


**Our journey continues tomorrow in Bahrain. Join us on your knees!**
