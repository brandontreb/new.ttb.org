 “God has changed my life completely!”


September 01, 2017




### *“God has changed my life completely!”* That’s the good news we hear today from a listener in Maharashtra, India.


He continues:


*“I did not have a very happy childhood. There was little peace and we were very poor. With great difficulty, I studied up to high school, but lack of funds prevented me from studying further. I was disappointed when I had to begin farming to make my living.*


*“Then one day, I heard about Jesus on your Deccani language program. I was intrigued to learn that He is the only Savior, and so I accepted Him as my Lord and King. Since that time, there is a newfound peace and joy in my life. Jesus has answered all my prayers and provided me with everything that I need … even crops that are prospering.* 


*“My parents, too, have accepted Jesus, but we are the only Christians in my village. We do not have a church and your program is our only source for the Word of God. Please keep broadcasting so we may continue to grow spiritually.”*


Praise God for the power of His Word to change our lives! Today let’s pray that more people in Maharashtra, India, will hear the truth on *Thru the Bible* and be saved. 


**On Monday we’re off to Indonesia. Hop aboard and pray with us!**
