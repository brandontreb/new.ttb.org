 A listener in Russia shares her excitement about Bible study


September 19, 2017




*“I am so happy to have recently found your programs!”* That’s what a listener in Russia tells us on World Prayer Today. 


She continues:


*“At the moment, I’m studying the book of Zechariah. I have learned so many new things about prophesies about Jesus, the future of Jerusalem, and the people of God. Today so few pulpit messages come from the minor prophets. And yet the Lord has a message for us in their stories. Praise God for you who teach the whole Bible! I am telling my friends and family to listen, so please keep broadcasting.”*


Russia is just one stop on our World Prayer journey this week. So today let’s ask God to raise up more listeners who want to study His whole Word throughout Russia and the entire Commonwealth of Independent States. 


And if you, too, are learning something new as we study God’s Word together, we’d love to hear from you. Email your story to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b1f3d8d3ddd4f3c4c2f1e5e5f39fdec3d6).


**Tomorrow we’re off to Tajikistan … we’ll meet you there!**
