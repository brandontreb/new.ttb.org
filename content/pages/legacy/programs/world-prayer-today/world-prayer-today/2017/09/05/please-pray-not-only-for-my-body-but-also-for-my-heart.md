 “Please pray not only for my body, but also for my heart …”


September 05, 2017




Spoken by more than 10 million people, Ilocano is the third most popular native language of the Philippines. 


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we travel to Northern Luzon, the largest and most populated island in the country. It’s here we stop and pray for God’s Word to reach more people like this listener who recently texted us to say:


*“I am grateful that you are always there for me.* *In spite of my leprosy, your Ilocano programs give me hope and strength to continue my life. My lower body is already numb, and I am not able to walk properly. It is easy to lose hope, but hearing the way you explain God’s Word keeps me going. Please pray not only for my body, but also for my heart. God’s Word is certainly changing me.”*


Yes! While we ask God to meet the physical needs of our listeners, let’s also ask Him to meet their spiritual needs. And while we pray for God’s Word to reach more people in the Ilocano language, let’s also pray for the millions of Filipinos who hear *Thru the Bible*’s broadcasts in Tagalog and Cebuano as well.


**Join us tomorrow as we pray our way through the Ring of Fire.**
