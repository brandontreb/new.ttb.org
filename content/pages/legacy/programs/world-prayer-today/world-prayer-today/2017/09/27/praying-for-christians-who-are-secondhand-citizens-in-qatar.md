 Praying for Christians who are “secondhand citizens” in Qatar


September 27, 2017




Widely considered “secondhand citizens,” Christians in Qatar are forbidden to share their faith, and evangelism of any kind can result in a 10-year prison sentence.


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we’re praying for God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* to break down barriers and find its way into the hearts of Qatari citizens. 


It won’t be easy. Converting to Christianity results in pressure from relatives and community leaders, and church attendance is not allowed.


But as we know, nothing is impossible for God. So as you bow before the throne today, join us in praying with confidence that God will use His Word to accomplish His will in the hearts of Qatari listeners.
