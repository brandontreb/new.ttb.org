 “The victory of Jesus Christ is my victory … I humbly claim it as my own.”


September 07, 2017




*“Now acquaint yourself with Him, and be at peace;* *thereby good will come to you.”* -Job 22:21


Although Buddhism is no longer considered the state religion of Myanmar, Christians and other minority groups continue to be harassed and violently persecuted. 


Despite these difficulties, God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* is bringing hope to believers like this one:


*“Thank you for your Bible study. I especially enjoyed the lesson on Job 22. My family and I are often battered by the waves of life’s difficulties, but as we study He whispers to us, replenishes us with new strength, and gives us His peace. Therefore, I praise the Lord that His Word is perfect and a protection for all who take refuge. Many people attempt to defeat us. But the Lord is always near us and protects the weak. The victory of Jesus Christ is my victory, and as we battle the forces of this world, I humbly claim it as my own.”*


Praise God for the lessons He is teaching each of us as we study His Word! Like this listener, let’s pray that more people in Myanmar will hear God’s Word and find the strength and peace that He offers us through a relationship with His Son, Jesus Christ.
