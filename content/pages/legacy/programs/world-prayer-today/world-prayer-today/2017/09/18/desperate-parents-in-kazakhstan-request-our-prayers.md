 Desperate parents in Kazakhstan request our prayers


September 18, 2017




*“We have been given very bad news. My seven-year-old son needs a brain operation.”* That’s what we hear from a listener in Kazakhstan today.


He continues:


*“The operation is very expensive and we will have to travel far. What shall we do? We feel very alone and paralyzed with fear. Please pray for us. We have heard your programs about trusting in the Lord and we want to know how. We want our son to have the assurance that God is with him.”*


What a heartbreaking letter. Today let’s pray for all those who face life threatening illnesses. Let’s pray that God’s Word will give them the assurance they need to make difficult decisions and the faith to put their hope and trust in Him.


**Tomorrow we’re off to Russia. Join us right here and invite a friend to join us for the journey at** **[**TTB.org/pray**](http://www.TTB.org/pray)****.**
