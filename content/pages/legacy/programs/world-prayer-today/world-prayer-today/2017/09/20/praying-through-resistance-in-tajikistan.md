 Praying through resistance in Tajikistan


September 20, 2017




With over 93% of people claiming Islam, very few in Tajikistan have had the opportunity to hear the gospel. 


And many who have heard of Jesus initially send emails like this one: 


*“**You call Jesus the Son of God. But He was only a prophet. By speaking of God and His Son, you bring people down the wrong path. If you do not know, ask those who know.”*


Praise God this listener contacted us and has begun communication. Today let’s pray for him and others like him. Ask God to open their minds and soften their hearts so they will hear the truth about Jesus. May those who vehemently oppose Him soon become champions of the faith in this region of the world and beyond.


**Tomorrow we pray alongside an isolated listener in Ukraine. Join us.**
