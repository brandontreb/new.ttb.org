 Praying Lamentations 5:21 through England


September 11, 2017




Lamentations 5:21 says, *“Turn us back to You, O Lord, and we will be restored; renew our days as of old.”* 


That’s what we’re praying for today as we travel through the country of England. What was once the homeland of great Christians like John Wesley, John Wycliffe, and William Tyndale is today a country desperately in need of spiritual renewal. 


As a listener in Suffolk recently wrote,


*“The greatest need for our country is a return to the Word of God. Please pray for us. We have introduced many friends to your programs and will continue to spread the Word. May the Lord prosper your work so you will have the great joy of hearing that more souls are saved through every broadcast.”*


Let’s echo this request and pray that many more in England and around the world will hear God’s Word and be saved. 


**Join us tomorrow as we pray with a teenager in Ireland who has discovered the joy of studying the Bible.**
