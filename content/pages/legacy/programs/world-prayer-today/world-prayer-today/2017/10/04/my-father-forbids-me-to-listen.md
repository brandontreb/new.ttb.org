 “My father forbids me to listen …”


October 04, 2017




1 Peter 4:16 says: “*Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter*.”


That’s what we’re praying for today as we sit down with a listener on the island of Taiwan. Here’s her story.


*“I love your programs, but I can only listen and communicate with you in secret. My father rejects my love of the Lord and forbids me to take part in anything having to do with Christianity. He is very strict and the consequences are great if I disobey. But I am not afraid. I praise God I continue to be encouraged by your programs and feel God’s love is with me. Please pray for me, that I may continue to listen and that I may bring glory to God in a way that will change the heart of my father.”* 


As we pray for this listener, let’s remember all those who are persecuted for their faith. As they study His Word and seek to glorify Him, let’s ask God to encourage and comfort them each day. 


**Rejoice with us tomorrow as we praise God for answered prayers in Japan.**
