 “I tried to do things the right way, but I still felt like a failure”


October 27, 2017




*“Hallelujah! I am a new woman because of your study in Romans.”*


That’s the joyous letter we recently received from a listener of our Indonesian broadcasts. She continues: 


*“I am blessed by your messages that talk about old law and new grace. I never felt like God could love me. I tried to do things the right way, but I still felt like a failure. I’m grateful to know that Jesus died on the cross for my sins and that His Spirit will help me live a righteous life. I pray others will come to know the truth through your programs and put their trust in Him.”*


Yes! As we echo her prayer for God’s Word to change the lives of many more listeners in Indonesia and around the world, let’s also thank Him for His grace in our lives, too. 


**Our team is headed to Africa next week. Come ready to pray!**
