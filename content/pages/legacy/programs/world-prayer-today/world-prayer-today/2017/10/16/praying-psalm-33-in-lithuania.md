 Praying Psalm 33 in Lithuania


October 16, 2017




*“Our soul waits for the**Lord**; He is our help and our shield. For our heart shall rejoice in Him, because we have trusted in His holy name.” -*Psalm 33:20, 21


That’s what a listener named Roma in Lithuania is praying today. Join us as she shares her story.


*“I’m grateful for your recent lesson that included an invitation to wait on the Lord. I’m usually in such a hurry that I try to do it all on my own. That’s why I’ve made so many, many mistakes in my life. As I study the Bible with you, I’m reminded that God’s ways are better than mine. So please pray that I may begin to wait on the Lord, to look to Him for help, and to trust Him in all situations.”*


What a great letter! As we pray for listeners in Lithuania today, let’s also pray that we, too, will slow down and wait on the Lord. As we trust in Him, may our hearts rejoice in knowing how deeply He cares for each detail in our lives.


**Tomorrow’s prayer stop: Romania. See you there.**
