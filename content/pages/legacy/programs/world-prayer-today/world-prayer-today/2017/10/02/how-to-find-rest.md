 How to find rest


October 02, 2017




*“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”* -Matthew 11:28


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we touch down in South Korea and visit with a listener named Ji-Eun. She shares:


*“It is comforting to hear that in Jesus we can find rest. I have yet to come through my suffering, so I am very discouraged. I am trying to learn more about Jesus’ life to gain perspective. After listening to today’s teaching, I am sad that our Savior endured such horrible pain on the cross, but I’m grateful that His experience shows us that we can overcome any hardship in His strength. I want to praise Jesus, pray, and live according to God’s Word until the day I experience no more hardships and I am welcomed into heaven.”*


Thank the Lord that in Him we can find rest! Today let’s ask Him to provide for the needs of listeners like this one who choose to trust Him despite their discouragement and disappointments.


**Tomorrow we travel on our knees northwest to Mongolia.**
