 Today we’re hitting the pavement with a listener named Charles in Seattle, Washington, as he runs through his neighborhood and listens to God’s Word.


October 11, 2017




*“And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints*.*”* -Ephesians 6:17, 18


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today as we pray our way across Canada, we stop in the province of Ontario to be encouraged by a listener named Margaret. 


*“Hello everyone at* Thru the Bible*! Just a quick note to say God has been working in mighty ways since I’ve hopped aboard the Bible Bus. He has given me the job of prayer warrior. Each morning, as I get dressed I remember Ephesians 6 and put on the whole armor of God as I pray for all the saints. I spend extra time praying especially for those who are persecuted. I also pray for each broadcast, asking the Lord to expand the normal reach and draw those who need His Word to tune in. I want to remind all those who pray with me that we are in a battle, but the victory belongs to the Lord. So, let’s press on with confidence and remember our brothers and sisters on the front lines. I believe consistent prayer and reliance on the Lord is the best way to defeat our enemy.”*


What great encouragement! Today as *Thru the Bible* broadcasts in more than 120 languages and dialects worldwide, let’s join Margaret and pray with the assurance that God is with us and the victory is His.


**Tomorrow on World Prayer Today, a listener in Ohio shares a very private and personal story of faith. Invite a friend to join us here at [TTB.org/pray](http://www.TTB.org/pray).**
