 “I am 85 years old and today I became a Christian.”


October 17, 2017




*“I am 85 years old and today I became a Christian.”*


That’s the good news we hear today from a listener named Ana in Romania. She continues: *“Not long ago I began listening, and this program has become so important to me. I listen every day. You have made salvation so easy to understand. I am grateful to have your introduction to the Lord.”*


Isn’t that amazing! Praise God His Word does not return void. Today let’s pray that everyone who hears *Thru the Bible* in Romania and around the world will come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. 


**Our journey continues tomorrow in Serbia. Travel with us on your knees.**
