 Praying our way through L.A.


October 13, 2017




Welcome to Los Angeles! As we make our way past the iconic Hollywood sign and streets lined with palm trees, we take a minute to meet with a listener named Federico. He shares:


*“God’s Word has come alive! Since I have systematically started studying the Bible with you, I am a different person. I am overcome with emotion at each message, and thanks to your clear exposition I understand more than I ever thought I would. I mostly listen in Spanish, but sometimes in English, too. What a joy to be able to pick! May God continue to use you to reach thousands and thousands in every language … people in all nations. I will continue to pray that the Most High will cover your every need in abundance.”*


His enthusiasm is wonderful, isn’t it? Today let’s join Federico and ask God to use *Thru the Bible* to reach people in every language … of all nations … for His glory. Through His Word may they come into a real and vibrant relationship with our Savior, Jesus Christ.  


**There’s more to pray about next week as we travel on our knees through Central Europe. We’ll meet you there.**
