 More than nine million people in Vietnam need our prayers


October 24, 2017




Welcome, World Prayer Team travelers! Our journey today brings us to Vietnam where a listener of our Hmong language broadcasts asks for prayer:


*“I heard your teaching on the radio and I have accepted Jesus as my personal Savior. Soon, my family did too. In my village, we cannot openly show others that we believe in Jesus, so we secretly worship only in our house. Please pray for us to be safe. We hope one day the government will open the door to believers to have freedom to worship our Lord. Thank you for giving us hope and salvation.”*


Praise God for the faith of this family! As we pray for their safety, also pray for the more than nine million Hmong people who have yet to hear the gospel. Let’s ask God to expand the reach of *Thru the Bible* broadcasts in Vietnam (and surrounding countries) so more Hmong families will come to know Him.


**We’ve got more to pray about tomorrow. Join us as we journey on our knees through the Philippines.**
