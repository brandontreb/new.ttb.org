 “God is good all the time …”


October 25, 2017




*“God is good all the time ….”* That’s what we hear from Emelina, a listener of our Cebuano language broadcasts in the Philippines. She continues:


*“I experienced many hardships and became depressed. I had many very dark days. But through your radio programs I met Jesus. Now I am confident that God’s grace is sufficient for me. He alone is more than enough. When I worry, I read His Word and remember that He promises never to leave us. My spiritual life becomes stronger each day. I really thank God for bringing this program to people not only in the cities but also in remote areas like mine. I pray more people in the countryside will hear God’s Word and He will ease their burdens.”*


As we rejoice in this new life in Christ, let’s ask God to bless the broadcasting of *Thru the Bible*’s Cebuano programs. Pray more listeners like Emelina will come to rely on His promises and grace.


**Then come back tomorrow and by encouraged by a testimony from Australia that gives hope to those battling depression.**
