 Hop aboard as we travel on our knees through Japan


October 05, 2017




God is answering our prayers! Thanks for joining us on World Prayer Today. 


As we travel on our knees today, we’re praising God for providing ways to reach the people of Japan with His Word. 


Over the years, broadcasting here hasn’t been easy, but God is faithful! After years of praying for an open door to resume broadcasts to Japan, God has recently answered our prayers above and beyond what we asked or imagined. TTB-Japanese is now aired on 11 FM stations across the country, including one in the capital city Tokyo! 


So, World Prayer Team, thank God for this breakthrough and pray that the more than 50% of the population of Japan who have never heard the gospel would find *Thru the Bible* and respond in faith to God’s invitation to life.


**Join us tomorrow as a listener with disabilities in China encourages us to give everything to God.**
