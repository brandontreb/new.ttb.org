 “I looked with disdain on the weak and the poor …”


October 18, 2017




Welcome to Serbia, World Prayer Team! As our journey through Central Europe continues this week, we are realizing the power of God’s Word to change lives. Here’s a story we recently received from a listener named Jovica.


*“I’ve always been pretty confident; I believed I could do anything in my own strength. I thought that people who complain or who have problems were pathetic. I enjoyed life, sins, and vices. I’ve always dated a few women at a time and had a private business that brought me a lot of money which I spent on myself.*


*“I looked with disdain on the weak and the poor … until one day I began to feel intense pain in my abdomen. When I went to the doctor he told me that I need to change my lifestyle and unhealthy habits. I was very worried about death. Then a friend gave me a Bible and told me about your programs.* 


*“The more I listened, the more I felt that I was missing the point of life. At your urging and through your explanation, I invited Christ into my life. My whole life has changed. The old man is dead! I am completely new! I’m so very grateful that God has revealed Himself through His Word.”*


Wow! Praise God for His work in Jovica’s life and in lives of so many others around the world— including our own. Today let’s pray that more hearts and minds will be open to God’s Word in Serbia.


**Pray with us tomorrow as we lift up God’s people in Poland.**
