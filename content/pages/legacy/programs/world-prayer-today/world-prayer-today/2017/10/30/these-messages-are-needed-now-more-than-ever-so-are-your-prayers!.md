 “These messages are needed now more than ever, so are your prayers!”


October 30, 2017




*“Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.”* -2 Timothy 4:2-4


Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we travel through Ethiopia today, we praise God for listeners like this one:


*“I am a pastor and there are false teachers in my community who are trying to confuse Christians on the trinity and other important spiritual matters. I am grateful for your programs that help and guide me as I speak against them. Please keep teaching the Bible. These messages are needed now more than ever. So are your prayers!”* 


He’s right! Your prayers are an important part of *Thru the Bible’s* ability to broadcast in countries like Ethiopia. Please keep interceding for faithful pastors like this one who preach the truth to a world that would rather hear lies.


**Thanks for your prayer and partnership. Tomorrow we’re off to Somalia.**
