 God’s Word is creeping into closed communities in Paraguay


June 09, 2017




### In the 1930’s Mennonites of German, Swiss German, and Dutch descent migrated to Paraguay from Russia. Today more than 40,000 live in 19 colonies, but in communities that are closed to outside teaching and influence. Those caught listening or studying outside materials can be persecuted.


Despite the risks, many Mennonites like this listener look for solid Bible teaching on *Thru the Bible* in their heart language of Low German (Plautdietsch): 


*“What a privilege to listen to God’s Word and finally understand it. It is as if the Bible has come alive. Thank you, thank you, thank you!”*


Today let’s pray for more Mennonite believers in Paraguay and throughout Latin America to have the opportunity to hear God’s Word and have the courage to listen. 


**Thank you for joining us in the privilege of prayer. Meet us back here on Monday as our journey takes us through the Middle East and North Africa.**
