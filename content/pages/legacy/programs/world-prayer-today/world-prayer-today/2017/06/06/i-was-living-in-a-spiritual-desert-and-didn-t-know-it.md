 “I was living in a spiritual desert and didn’t know it”


June 06, 2017




### *“Your words of encouragement are fresh water to my soul.”*


That’s what we hear from a listener named Jose as we travel on our knees through the Latin American country of Peru on World Prayer Today. He continues:


*“I was living in a spiritual desert and didn’t know it. The first time I heard your program was a year and a half ago on Radio Integrity in Lima, Peru. Now I listen on my cell phone. At work, on the street, whenever I can put on my headphones … I tune in. One program ends and another begins, I don’t want to stop listening. And if I don’t understand something, I repeat it again and again until it makes sense. I have wasted so much time in my life by focusing on vanity … now I want to only focus on the truth. Thank you for introducing me to Jesus and giving me a love for studying the Bible.”*


What a great letter! Today let’s pray that more people in Peru will hear the truth and devote themselves to studying God’s Word. And like Jose, let’s ask God to give each of us a thirst in our souls that only His Word can satisfy.


**Tomorrow’s stop on our World Prayer tour is the lovely Puerto Rico. Join us there.**
