 “Your prayers are not in vain.”


June 05, 2017




### In 2 Corinthians 5:17 Paul said, “*Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.”*


That’s also what we hear from one *Thru the Bible* listener named Freddy as we travel on our knees through the country of Bolivia. He writes:


*“Not more than about a year ago I began to tune in to your program. I like to listen in the morning while I’m on my way to work, and I confess that with each day that passes, I feel my life is not the same as before. I really do feel like a ‘new creation’ when I listen to the Word of God. I want you to know your work and your prayers are not in vain. … I am very grateful to God to have you as my brothers and sisters. You are a blessed instrument so that more people can learn and apply the Word of God to their lives. May God use your programs to change lives throughout my country.”*


What a great prayer. As you come before the Father today, please lift up those who hear *Thru the Bible* in Spanish and the native language of Quechua. 


**Tomorrow we’re praying our way through Peru—we’ll meet you right here.**
