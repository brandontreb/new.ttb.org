 Praying for little hearts and minds in Switzerland


June 30, 2017




### *“Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.”* -Matthew 18:3


Welcome, World Prayer travelers. Today we’re in the gorgeous country of Switzerland, where we meet with a listener named Nicco:


*“I am a child, and I would love to have a Bible—if possible, a cartoon one as my reading is not that good. Do you have one that you would recommend? My mother and I listen to your programs and* *I love God’s Word, especially the stories about Jesus. I would like to read them on my own.”*


Isn’t that encouraging? Let’s praise God today for the salvation and spiritual foundation for young believers like Nicco and for their mothers and fathers who plant and cultivate the seeds of faith in little hearts and minds. 


**Next week we’re headed to Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Come back to pray with us, won’t you?**
