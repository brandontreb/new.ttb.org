 God’s Word is awakening souls in India


June 20, 2017




### *“Like Mary sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to His words, we also sit near the radio every day eagerly awaiting your teaching*.”


That’s the encouragement we received today from a listener in India who gathers friends in her home to listen to *Thru the Bible*. Here’s the rest of her story:


*“We are a small group of women who praise God for the blessings we receive through each broadcast. Every day the Lord wakes us early and we are impatient for Him to teach us His wonders and the deep truths that are leading us into a closer walk with Him. Our prayer is that God will continue to use you to awaken new souls in India to His glory.”*


What a beautiful prayer. Let’s join her in praying for the wide reach and deep impact of God’s Word in India. May each broadcast draw more people to Him.


**Tomorrow we’re praying our way through West Bengal. Join us as we travel the world on our knees.**
