 “Although alone, I do not feel lonely.”


June 23, 2017




### *“I’m the only believer in my family ….”*


That’s the beginning of a letter from a listener of our Kannada language broadcast in India. Can you relate? Here is what she says next:


*“It was only by the grace of God that I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. Since then I have given up idol worship. I no longer want to indulge in any of those meaningless rituals. However, I have no freedom to go to church as everyone here opposes my faith. Besides, I am unable to read so the Bible was meaningless to me. But then, I discovered your broadcasts. You have both stirred my hunger for spiritual knowledge and quenched it with the Word of God. I depend on you daily. Each night, I lock my room and listen to the broadcasts and pray with the preacher on the radio. It strengthens me and helps to feel a part of a bigger community—one that believes in the Lord Jesus and worships Him without reserve. Although alone, I do not feel lonely. God’s Word is with me wherever I go, and He has sent me your broadcasts to guide and teach me. Thank you for being my spiritual family.”*


What a wonderful reminder that with God, we are never alone. Do you know someone who needs to hear that message today? 


As we bow our heads, let’s also pray for this listener and those who feel alone in their faith—in India and around the world. May God give them courage and comfort as they follow Him.
