 Boldly praying our way through Spain


June 29, 2017




### As our journey through Western Europe continues this week, today we stop in Spain to meet with a listener who requests our prayer.


*“Every night at midnight, I stop doing anything else so that I can listen to this program. It is a great blessing to me, especially because there is so much bad news that surrounds us all the time. Each of your messages is like fresh air for my soul. There is so much confusion and doubt these days, God’s Word is needed now more than ever. I pray your voice will fill the homes of my children and each person in Spain. Will you join me?”*


Yes! Let’s boldly echo her request and ask God to make His Word be heard by every man, woman, and child in Spain! 


**Ready for a prayer journey to the Alps? Meet you in Switzerland tomorrow.**
