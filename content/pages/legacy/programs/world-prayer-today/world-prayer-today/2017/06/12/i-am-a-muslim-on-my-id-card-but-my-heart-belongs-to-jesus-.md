 “I am a Muslim on my ID card, but my heart belongs to Jesus.”


June 12, 2017




### *“I am a Muslim on my ID card, but my heart belongs to Jesus.”*


That’s the good news we hear from a listener in Oman today where more than 77 percent of the people have never heard the gospel. He continues his story:


*“Your program guides me through the toughest times in my life. Thank you for being the church and the tool that the Lord has made available for me to continue this journey with Him!”*


Isn’t that amazing? Although religious freedom is technically guaranteed in Oman, sharing the gospel with Muslims remains illegal. So today let’s thank God that He is reaching Omanis with His Word on the radio. Let’s also ask the Lord to continue to break down barriers and provide new ways for Omanis to hear the Good News of our Savior, Jesus Christ.


**We’ll travel on our knees through Libya tomorrow. Join us, won’t you?**
