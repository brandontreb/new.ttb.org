 “Until my final breath, I will sing an anthem to Him.”


June 27, 2017




### Psalm 146:2 says, *“While I live I will praise the**Lord**; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.”*


Thanks for joining us on World Prayer Today. Today we make our way through the bustling cities and quaint country sides of Germany. Let’s sit a while with a 94-year-old listener in Bavaria who shares: 


*“I used to be a teacher of the Old Testament and Hebrew at a local seminary. But at 94 years of age, my eyesight is poor and I have trouble reading. A friend has recently introduced me to your programs and I am very enthusiastic to hear more. Your interpretation of the book of Psalms has taken me back to my years of pouring over each Word in God’s precious book. I have much of the Bible memorized, but there is something about having it read aloud that refreshes my weary soul. God’s Word is the music that has played in the background of my entire life, thank you for restoring the notes that were lost to me. Until my final breath, I will to sing an anthem to Him.”*


Does your soul need refreshment too? As we pray today, let’s lift up one another and the people of Germany … and like this listener, may we sing the praises of the Lord until He calls us home.


**Tomorrow we continue to travel on our knees through Europe—destination: The Netherlands.**
