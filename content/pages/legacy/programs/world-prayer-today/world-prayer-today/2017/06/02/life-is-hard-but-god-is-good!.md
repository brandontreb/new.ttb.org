 “Life is hard, but God is good!”


June 02, 2017




## *“Your Fongbe program has changed my life.”*


That’s what we hear from a listener of our Fongbe language broadcasts in the African country of Benin. 


He continues: 


“*I am always full of joy. Life is hard, but God is good! I am so happy that I copy the program in my phone and share it with other people. Sharing with them also gives me joy. Thank you for helping me know God’s Word.*”


His enthusiasm is contagious, isn’t it? As we pray today, let’s thank God that His Word is reaching many hearts in Benin. And as we intercede for listeners in this west African nation, here are a few facts that can direct our prayers.


* One-third of the population of Benin lives in poverty, and two-thirds are illiterate.
* More than 50,000 children are sold in slavery each year, most to neighboring Nigeria.
* Christianity is growing in Benin, but many continue to practice animism and voodoo as well.
* There is a great need for trained pastors and media ministry to share the gospel with those who cannot read.


**Next week our World Prayer journey takes us to Latin America. Meet us on Monday as we pray our way through Bolivia.**
