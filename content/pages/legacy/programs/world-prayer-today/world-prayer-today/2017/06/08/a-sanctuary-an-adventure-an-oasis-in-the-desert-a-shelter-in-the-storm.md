 A sanctuary, an adventure, an oasis in the desert, a shelter in the storm …


June 08, 2017




### Welcome, prayer warriors. Today we land in the loud and lush city of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. As we pass the many bars and samba clubs that fill the air with music, we turn on to a quiet street and meet with a listener named Jair.


*“I have been listening to your programs since I was 14 years old. In my youth, God’s Word was my sanctuary … a way to escape all the temptations that tantalized me. Today, I am the pastor of a church and use what you have taught me to lead my congregation. Now, instead of an escape, God’s Word is an adventure. Many nights I listen to you over and over again, wrestling with some of the Bible’s more difficult passages to understand. Thank you for guiding me through it all and always reminding me that God loves us more than we can understand. It is my sincere prayer that I can do the same for others.”*


A sanctuary, an adventure, an oasis in the desert, a shelter in the storm … God’s Word is all of those things and more! Today let’s praise God for what His Word means to us and ask Him to bless the ministry of listeners like Jair who lead others in a journey through the Bible as well.


**Our journey through Latin America ends tomorrow in Paraguay. Join us and invite a friend!**
