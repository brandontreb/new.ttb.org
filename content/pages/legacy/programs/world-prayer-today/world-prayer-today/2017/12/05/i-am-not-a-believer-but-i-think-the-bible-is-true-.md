 “I am not a believer, but I think the Bible is true.”


December 05, 2017




God is answering our prayers! That’s what we are celebrating all month long here at World Prayer Today. Join as we rejoice in this letter from a listener in Mongolia.


*“I thank you for the radio you gave to me. I have been listening to your programs since I received it. I am not a believer. However, whenever I listen to your explanations, I think the Bible is true.”*


Today, let’s thank the Lord that the broadcasting of His Word is planting seeds in the hearts of millions of people in Mongolia and all over the world. As God calls them, let’s pray each one responds in faith to His gracious offer of salvation through His Son, Jesus Christ.


**We’ll be celebrating other victories around the world tomorrow. Please join us in prayer and praise!**
