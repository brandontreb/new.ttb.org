 Hebrews 11:1 stops a mother from committing suicide


December 07, 2017




*“I wanted to take my life.”*


That’s the start of a letter we recently received from a listener of our Zulu language broadcasts. She continues:


*“I lost my husband three years ago. I had to provide for my children and I was having no luck finding a job. Life was difficult without shelter and food. I used to listen to the news through my cellphone, but one day I came across your program. The teacher was talking about Hebrews 11:1 that says, ‘Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.’ Since that day my life changed. I gave my life to the Lord, and I found a job! It wasn’t a great job, but it was the beginning of a new life for me and my girls in so many ways. Thank you for bringing us the Word of God. We will continue to listen and trust in the Lord as our Father and friend.”*


Praise the Lord for the new life He offers all of us through a relationship with His Son, Jesus Christ! Today let’s pray more people hear *Thru the Bible’s* Zulu broadcasts and come to a saving relationship with Him.
