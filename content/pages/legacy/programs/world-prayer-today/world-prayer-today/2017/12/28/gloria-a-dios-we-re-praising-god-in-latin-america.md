 Gloria a Dios … we’re praising God in Latin America


December 28, 2017




*Gloria a Dios!* Glory to God in the Highest!


That’s what we hear from Silvia, a listener of our Spanish broadcasts in Latin America. She continues:


*“Thanks to your programs I now start my day with God. What a difference it makes. A month ago, I was looking for some music as I was cleaning my home and I heard your teaching. Instinctively, I sat down and listened. Now I wake up every day, grab my Bible, and hop on the Bible Bus. It helps me start my day well … with great strength … because I know God is with me. Even my co-workers have noticed and ask me what has changed. I love telling them and inviting them to listen as well!”*


Don’t you love her enthusiasm? As we continue to celebrate God’s work in the lives of listeners around the world, let’s celebrate how He works in our lives too. And as we study His Word together in 2018, may we join Silvia and shout His praises to the world. 


**Let’s close out 2017 in prayer, shall we? Join us tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
