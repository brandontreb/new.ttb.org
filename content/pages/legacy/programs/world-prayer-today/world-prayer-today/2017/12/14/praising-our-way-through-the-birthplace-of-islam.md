 Praising our way through the birthplace of Islam


December 14, 2017




Welcome, World Prayer travelers! Today we’re praising God for His Word that is changing lives in the birthplace of Islam, Saudi Arabia. Together, let’s rejoice in this good news:


*“I don’t have words to express my joy in finding your teaching. It has been almost 30 years since I accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior, but I regret I do not understand much of the Bible. I used to attend some secret fellowships here in Saudi Arabia, but it is very dangerous. I praise God that your programs are the answer to my long-time prayer requests. I now listen every day and have invited a few of the individuals who live with me to join me. Through your beautiful messages they, too, have accepted Christ. There are severe consequences for changing our religion in our country, but our hope is Jesus Christ. May God bless your radio ministry and the producers as you fill our table with the bread of life.”*


**Isn’t that amazing? We’ve got more to celebrate tomorrow in India. Join us on World Prayer Today!**
