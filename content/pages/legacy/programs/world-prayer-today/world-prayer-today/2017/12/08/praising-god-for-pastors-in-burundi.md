 Praising God for pastors in Burundi


December 08, 2017




Poverty, child malnourishment, AIDS, malaria—these are all realities that many Burundians deal with every day. That’s why if you’ve been on the World Prayer Team very long, you know that Burundi holds a special place in our hearts. 


Pray today that God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* will bring hope in the middle of their suffering. That’s exactly what one listener recently wrote to say:


*“I am happy to hear your program every evening. It is a blessing to me. I am a preacher and use your programs to teach myself more about God’s Word. I also tell everyone I meet to listen. It is my prayer that they hear about the hope and joy found in our Lord, Jesus Christ. Each lesson inspires me to reach more of my people in His name. I will continue praying for you in your good work and ask that you will pray for mine.”*


What a great letter! Today let’s praise God for this pastor and all those who serve His church. And, let’s pray that He will call more to the ministry in Burundi and every country of the world.


**We’ll celebrate God at work again next week right here on World Prayer Today.**
