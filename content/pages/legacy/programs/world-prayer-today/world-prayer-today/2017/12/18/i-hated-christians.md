 “I hated Christians”


December 18, 2017




*“I hated Christians.”*


That’s the beginning of a dramatic letter we recently received from a listener named Narayan in Maharashtra, India. Here’s the rest of her story:


*“But ironically, I found Jesus through your radio program and became a believer. My life has been transformed thanks to God’s Word. I am filled as I receive God’s Word through your program.”*


What a great note! Praise God that He can change even the hardest of hearts! Today let’s pray He’ll use *Thru the Bible* broadcasts to soften more hearts and draw more listeners into an eternal relationship with Him through His Son, Jesus.


**We’ve got more good news to share tomorrow. Join us in Uzbekistan.**
