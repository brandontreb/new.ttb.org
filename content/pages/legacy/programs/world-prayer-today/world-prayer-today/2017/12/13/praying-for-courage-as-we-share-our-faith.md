 Praying for courage as we share our faith


December 13, 2017




James 1:19, 20 says, *“So then,my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.”*


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we’re traveling to Turkey to find out how this verse changed the life of a young man. He writes:


*“I grew up with a father who had an anger problem. In our house there was always fighting. I thought that it was normal, the way everyone lived. My father was angry about everything and it was impossible to discuss anything with him. As I became a teenager, I noticed I was beginning to have the same problem. I saw that my father’s anger harmed me and my family, but I could not control it on my own, either.*


*“One day a friend recommended your program and I started to listen. After the first program I said to him: ‘What does Christianity have to do with my problem?’ He encouraged me to keep listening. Shortly after, I heard your teachings in James and my life was changed. I kept repeating James 1:19 and 20 over and over in my head. It softened my heart and I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. Now, I feel as though the anger is seeping out of my body. I want so badly to tell my family about Jesus … about how He can replace anger with joy, but I’m afraid that my father will be upset. I feel ashamed that I am 25 years old and afraid of my father, so please pray that I might have courage.”*


Today let’s praise God for the transforming power of His Word in the life of this listener and so many others around the world. And let’s pray that the Holy Spirit gives each of us the conviction and courage to share our faith—even when we are afraid.
