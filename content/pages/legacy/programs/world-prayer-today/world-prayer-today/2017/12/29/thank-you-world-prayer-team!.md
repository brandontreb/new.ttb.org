 Thank you World Prayer Team!


December 29, 2017




What a fantastic journey! Thank you for your fellowship and faithfulness as we’ve traveled the world on our knees! 


If you’ve not yet done so, take a few minutes to consider how this joyful discipline of intercession has impacted you this year. 


* What country or story stands out in your memory this year? Who do you remember praying for?
* How did God use this prayer journey in your life? Do you see the world any differently?

**Let’s start again on Monday! Our 2018 prayer journey around the world begins again right here on World Prayer Today.**
