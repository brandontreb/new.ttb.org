 “I came to the conclusion that Jesus is the true God.”


December 22, 2017




With a population of over one billion people speaking 1,600 different languages, reaching India with the gospel is a daunting task. But praise God, one at a time, He is drawing people to Himself. Together, let’s celebrate this letter from a listener in Punjab.


*“I have been regularly listening to your programs for the past four years. Before knowing Jesus, I was a seeker of truth who diligently browsed through teachings and tenets of various religions on the internet.*


*“One day in the cyber cafe, a Hindu friend of mine (who was also a seeker) introduced me to you. I searched online for your website to gather information and began to listen. Thereafter my faith began to grow, and I came to the conclusion that Jesus is the true God, the sole Savior of this world and hence of my life, too. That’s when I gave my life to God. Now I share this program with others.**”*


Join us in praising God for the truth found in His Word! Let’s also ask Him to use *Thru the Bible* to open the eyes of those who are ready to hear it! **Join us on Monday as together we celebrate the birth of our Savior.**
