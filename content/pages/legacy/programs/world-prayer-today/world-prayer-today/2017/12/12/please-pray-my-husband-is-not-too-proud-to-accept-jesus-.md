 “Please pray my husband is not too proud to accept Jesus.”


December 12, 2017




One of the most frequent prayer requests we receive at *Thru the Bible* is for family members who are far from God. Natalia, a listener of our Ukrainian broadcasts, recently asked us to pray for her husband:


*“Not long ago, I was baptized in our local church and as a gift I was given a micro card of your broadcasts. I am so happy that I don’t have to wait until Sunday to receive teaching from God’s Word; I can listen at home whenever I choose. My husband and I are retired, and he has started to listen with me. Although he listens, he has not yet accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior. I pray he is not too proud or stubborn to realize his need. My heart aches for him to know the joy and the relief of submitting to the will of God. Will you pray with me? In the meantime, I will continue to feast on the Word of God that you have so lovingly prepared.”*


Can you relate to her request? As we praise God for the faith of this new sister, let’s remember her husband and the family members and friends of all those who listen to *Thru the Bible*. May their eyes be opened to the outstretched arms of our gracious and wonderful Savior.


**We’ll be celebrating in Turkey tomorrow. Hop aboard and join us.**
