 Praising in spite of persecution


December 06, 2017




First Peter 3:14, says, *“But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. ‘And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.’”* 


That’s what we’re praising and praying for today as we travel on our knees through Assam, India. Together, let’s celebrate this letter from a listener named Debo.


*“I’m 44 years old, married, and have two children. In 2005, I became very sick and a neighbor shared your programs while I was bedridden. I praise God that during this time, He not only healed my body, but He saved my soul. I began attending a church, but people in my village found out and chased me and my family away.*


*“Although I was discouraged, I was not deterred in my faith. I had heard through your programs that we may suffer for our faith in Jesus Christ and I was not afraid. In fact, we left with kindness and continue to pray for those who opposed us.*


*“My family soon moved to another district and continued to find deep and meaningful satisfaction in God as we listened to your explanations of the Bible. Here we also began a radio group in our home. There are eight of us who listen to your programs and discuss God’s Word. Two of my brothers who live close by have also come to visit our group, and have now begun to listen with their families as well. The Lord is blessing us and I am ever grateful for your program that has made it all possible.”*


Praise God for the faith of this brave listener and the many others who choose to follow Jesus, despite the persecution they experience. Today, let’s pray that the broadcasting of God’s Word flourishes in more hearts and homes of listeners in Assam and throughout India.


**Join us tomorrow for the testimony of a distraught widow in Africa.**
