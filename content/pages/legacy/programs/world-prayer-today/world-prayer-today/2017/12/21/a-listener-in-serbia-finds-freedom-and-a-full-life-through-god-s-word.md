 A listener in Serbia finds freedom and a full life through God’s Word


December 21, 2017




Psalm 19:8 says, *“The statutes of the**Lord**are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the**Lord**is pure, enlightening the eyes.”*


That’s what we’re celebrating today as we meet with a listener named Svetlana in Serbia. She says:


*“Since I have started studying the Bible with you, my life has gained significance. I now understand what Psalm 19:8 means. I started to discover the hidden treasure in God’s Word and as I follow it I find joy and peace. I always thought the Bible was full of restriction, but now I know that it leads to freedom and a full life.* 


*“Those who know me from before told me that I have changed so much. I have become more polite and unselfish. I have started to help other people who are in need. I have started to realize that monetary wealth is not what life is about. Thank you to all of you that bring me these programs … please pray my family will begin to listen with me.”*


What a great letter! Today let’s praise God that as we follow His Word we, too, can find freedom and a full life. And let’s pray more people in war-torn Serbia will find the joy and peace offered through a relationship with our Savior, Jesus Christ.


**We’re celebrating God’s goodness all month long. Join us tomorrow for our journey to Punjab, India.**
