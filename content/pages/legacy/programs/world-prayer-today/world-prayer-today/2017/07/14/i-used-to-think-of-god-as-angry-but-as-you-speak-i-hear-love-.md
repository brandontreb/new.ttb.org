 “I used to think of God as angry, but as you speak, I hear love.”


July 14, 2017




As we make our way through Northern Iraq, we stop and pray for listeners of *Thru the Bible*’s Kurdish language broadcasts. 


One listener writes:


*“I have listened to your Bible program for some time. It is interesting to me, as everything you speak of is new. I’m wondering if what I have been taught about religion is a lie. I used to think of God as angry, but as you speak, I hear love.”*


Isn’t that great? Let’s pray that more Kurdish speaking Iraqis will hear God’s Word on *Thru the Bible*. Through each study, may the love of God be evident in miraculous and tangible ways.


**There is more to pray about next week as our journey continues in Northeast Asia.**
