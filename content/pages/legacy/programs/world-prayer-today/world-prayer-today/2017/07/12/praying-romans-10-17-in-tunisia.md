 Praying Romans 10:17 in Tunisia


July 12, 2017




Welcome to Tunisia. Today we’re celebrating the power of God’s Word to change lives. 


Listen to this miraculous letter from a listener of *Thru the Bible*’s Arabic broadcast:


*“I was a very radical follower of Islam. I was against all other religions in the world except my own. I recited the Quran by heart and I learned all the religious narratives, those of the prophet and his followers. I did not harm anyone, but I was very guarded. One day, I traveled with a gentle Christian who greeted me every time we met each other on our journey. I took this opportunity to talk to him about my faith, hoping to bring him back to my religion. The first thing that came to my mind was to ask him what he thought of those who see my religion as evil, and of those who put it into practice to fulfill the righteousness of God? His answer was clear-cut. He said to me: ‘Your question is good! No one can give you a convincing answer except the Word of Jesus Christ in the Bible. If you want, I will share some verses with you.’ So he shared some verses. I am 40 years old, but this was the first time I received a word full of sparkling truth. From that day on, I have listened to your programs and I have given my life to Jesus Christ. He is my Lord, whom I now proclaim.”*


As it says in Romans 10:17, *“So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”* Let’s pray more people in Tunisia will hear God’s Word and be transformed! 


**There’s a lot to pray about tomorrow as the World Prayer Team heads to Syria. We’ll see you there.**
