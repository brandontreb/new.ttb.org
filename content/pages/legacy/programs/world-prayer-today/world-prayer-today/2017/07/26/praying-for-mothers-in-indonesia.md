 Praying for mothers in Indonesia


July 26, 2017




### *“Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.”* -Proverbs 22:6


Thank you for joining us on World Prayer Today. Our journey brings us to Indonesia where we stop and visit with a mother who shares her story: 


*“I have learned many things from the Madurese programs. Yesterday I learned about the role of a godly mother in a family. I have learned that a mother should love her children, try to educate them in God’s Word, and to point them to know Jesus Christ. This is my prayer, this is my duty … that I would be a mother who is an example of the Lord Jesus Christ and lead them in the way of righteous living.”*


Today let’s praise God for mothers who follow Proverbs 22:6. May the Lord bless their efforts and their children grow up to honor God.


**We’re heading back to Vietnam tomorrow. Join us as we pray for a unique and important ministry.**
