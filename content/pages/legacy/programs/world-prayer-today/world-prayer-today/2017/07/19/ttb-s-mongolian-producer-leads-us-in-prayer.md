## 
 TTB’s Mongolian producer leads us in prayer


July 19, 2017




### *“O God, You know our situation. There is too much unrighteousness and faithlessness in our society. How can we pass this sin and ungodly ways to our children? O God, please take care us, please send Your Spirit to change Mongolia into a nation that worships Jesus Christ.”*


That’s the prayer that recently went out on our Mongolian broadcast. 


Will you join our producer, Bat Tuvshintsengel, and his team in asking God to transform hearts through His Word? With each message that airs, pray that God will be glorified and that a revival will begin in the hearts of the Mongolian people. 


**Your prayer partnership is needed again tomorrow. Join us as we travel on our knees to North Korea.**
