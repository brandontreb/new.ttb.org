 “Jesus is real!”


July 21, 2017




### *“Jesus is real.”*


That’s the good news we hear from a listener of *Thru the Bible*’s Cantonese broadcasts. He continues with some good advice:


*“I left the Lord and the church because I wanted to make money. I found that the devil would attack me whenever there was a chance. I struggled and was hurt deeply. When I realized my error, I repented to the Lord and returned to the church. I was graciously welcomed back, but it took me some time to recover and leave my sinfulness behind. Thankfully the Word of God is very powerful. As I listened to your broadcasts and members of my church prayed, I was restored. Friends, we must not lose connection with God. With God there is peace. If the Lord helps us, we have no fear. I pray that your listeners will hear my story and not stray from their first love … the love of Jesus Christ. May He be in your heart always.”*


As we pray today, let’s ask God to bless this gentleman and all those who listen to *Thru the Bible*’s Cantonese broadcasts. May He give them the strength and perseverance to stay firm in their faith despite worldly temptations. 


**We’re off to Southeast Asia next week. We will meet you here on Monday.**
