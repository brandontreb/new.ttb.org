 “We pray with our eyes open.”


July 20, 2017




### *“It’s dangerous to be a Christian. We pray with our eyes open.”*


That’s what Christians fleeing North Korea are saying to ministry partners in this region. 


While no one knows for sure, it’s reported that those who profess Jesus Christ in North Korea are subjected to imprisonment, torture, beatings, and starvation. 


So let’s pray that God’s Word broadcasted on *Thru the Bible* in South Korea will reach across the border and change more lives. And while we’re at it, let’s intercede for God’s people in North Korea. Ask the Lord to protect and multiply their numbers despite the threats of horrific persecution. 


**Tomorrow we travel to Taiwan. Invite a friend along for the prayer journey.**
