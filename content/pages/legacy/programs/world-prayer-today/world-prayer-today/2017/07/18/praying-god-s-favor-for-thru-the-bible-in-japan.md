 Praying God’s favor for Thru the Bible in Japan


July 18, 2017




### *“And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands for us; yes, establish the work of our hands.”* -Psalm 90:17


That’s what we’re praying today for Hiroyuki Fukuda, *Thru the Bible*’s Japanese producer and our team in Japan. 


Although our first messages launched in 1979, consistently broadcasting God’s Word throughout Japan hasn’t been easy. But praise God over the years we’ve continued to see Him open doors that were previously shut.


So please join us in proclaiming God’s goodness and praying that He will expand the opportunity to broadcast His Word so more Japanese people will come to faith in Jesus Christ.


**Join us for more prayer and praise tomorrow in Mongolia.**
