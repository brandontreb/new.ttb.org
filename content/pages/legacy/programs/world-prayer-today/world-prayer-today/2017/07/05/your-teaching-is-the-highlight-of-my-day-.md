 “Your teaching is the highlight of my day.”


July 05, 2017




### *“Your teaching is the highlight of my day.”*


That’s what we hear from a listener of our Romanian broadcasts in the country of Moldova. He continues: 


*“My wife and I are 80 years old and our health is poor. There are days when it feels as though life’s joys are no longer available to us, but hearing God’s Word changes our minds. Instead of longing for Him to take us home, we are renewed by His Word and grateful for each minute we have to get to know Him better.”*


Yes! Praise God that His Word is bringing hope and life to listeners of all ages in Moldova. As we intercede for more people to hear His Word, here are a few things to keep in mind:


* Although Moldova boasts many natural resources, it is the poorest nation in Europe.
* 72% of the population lives below the poverty line and 60-80% of adults are unemployed.
* Many family members leave home to find work in nearby countries, leaving children to be raised by single parents or elderly grandparents.
* Although more than 70% of Moldovans consider themselves to be Eastern Orthodox Christians, only 3% claim Jesus Christ as their Savior.
* More than 800 villages have no pastor or church.


**Thank you for joining us in the privilege of prayer. Join us tomorrow as our World Prayer Team heads to the Central-Asian nation of Turkmenistan.**
