 Praying for God’s priorities to be our own


July 24, 2017




### *“… For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.”* -2 Corinthians 4:18


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we’re in Vietnam visiting with a listener who requests our prayers:


*“I am sick and with difficulties. God’s Word from your program feeds my spiritual life and encourages me to move forward. I believe that the Lord is with me and comforts me. Please pray that I may focus on things that are eternal instead of my own troubles. I wish to have God’s priorities as my own.”*


What a great reminder! As we pray today, let’s ask God to help us all focus on what is eternal instead of what is temporary. And while we’re interceding, let’s also ask God to use *Thru the Bible*’s broadcasts to reach more people in Vietnam with the Good News of Jesus Christ. 


**Pray with us again tomorrow as our travels through Southeast Asia continue here on World Prayer Today.**
