 Praying God’s Word in the war zone


July 13, 2017




*“You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.”* -1 John 4:4


*“*Thru the Bible *is my refuge in this war zone.”*


That’s what we hear from Mohib, a listener of our Arabic broadcasts in Syria. He continues:


*“When I study the Word of God with you, I truly experience heavenly joy! Keeping close to the Word of God keeps my soul refreshed and at peace, although all the surroundings here in Syria are a source of disturbance and self-destruction. But I believe in 1 John 4:4 and trust that He who is within me is greater than anything in this world. Please pray for peace. If we can’t have peace in our land, please pray with me that more people will find Jesus and have peace in their hearts.”* 


What a great prayer. Let’s join Mohib in asking God to change hearts in Syria through His Word.


**Tomorrow we’ll be praying and praising our way through Iraq. Travel on your knees with us.**
