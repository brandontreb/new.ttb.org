## 
 God’s light is shining in China


July 17, 2017




### *“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.”* -Matthew 5:16


Welcome to World Prayer Today. Our journey brings us to China where a listener of our Mandarin broadcasts wants to make these words a priority in his life. He says:


*“I have decided not to be a hypocrite. I want to change my foolish ways and be salt and light for God. I am a sinner and your program helps me understand how to make better choices. Please pray that I will be filled with wisdom and that the Spirit of God will change me from the inside out.”*


That’s a great request. Today let’s pray that more people will hear God’s Word and want to be salt and light for Him. And let’s pray that God gives each of us that desire, too.


**Journey with us to Japan tomorrow. We’ll meet you here on our knees.**
