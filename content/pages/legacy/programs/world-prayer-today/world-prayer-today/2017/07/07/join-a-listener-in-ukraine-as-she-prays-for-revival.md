 Join a listener in Ukraine as she prays for revival


July 07, 2017




### Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we stop in the Ukraine to pray alongside a listener who is asking God to bring revival to her community. This is what she has to say:


*“I am a 70-year-old widow. I have listened to Thru the Bible for seven years now. I never miss a program. You are like my family. I am praying for you and thanking God that such programs exist. Our village is very small. A pastor from a neighboring village visits us from time to time. We used to have about 30 members in our church. But many passed away, and we are only seven. We pray that more people will study God’s Word with us and the Lord would send a revival into our village. We believe that He will answer our requests. Pray also with us.”*


What a great request. Today let’s join her in praying that more people will study God’s Word and that their faithfulness will spark a revival that spreads from their hearts, through their village, and across the country of Ukraine.


**There’s more to pray about next week. Join us as our journey takes us through the Middle East and North Africa.**
