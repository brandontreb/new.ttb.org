 How is God’s Word impacting you?


July 31, 2017




### *“I hopped on the Bible Bus at the last minute … in Revelation. I was so blessed that I stayed on for the next five-year tour.”*


That’s what we hear from a listener named Trish in Surrey, British Columbia. She continues:


*“Right now, I’m in the book of Joshua and the crossing of the river Jordan. I was touched as Dr. McGee explained that the 12 stones left in the river portray the death of Christ and the twelve stones set up at Gilgal represent the resurrection of Christ.* 


*“It is so great that the Bible Bus connects believers so we can pray and study together. It makes us family. Thank you for all you do to make this happen. I had been reading through the Bible on my own for some years, but Dr. McGee’s perspective has opened up new vistas. I’m planning to ride forever, Lord willing, and am looking forward to the journey.”*


What are you learning as we travel through God’s Word? We’d love to hear your story! Call and leave a message on our listener testimony line at 1-800-65-BIBLE or email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)


And as you pray today, ask the Lord to fill the Bible Bus with many new passengers in Canada and around the world.


**We’re headed to Southern California tomorrow. Bring your sunscreen and meet us there.**
