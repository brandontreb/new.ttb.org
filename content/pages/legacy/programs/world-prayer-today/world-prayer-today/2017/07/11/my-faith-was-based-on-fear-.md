 “My faith was based on fear.”


July 11, 2017




*“I grew up as an only child in an atheist family. My family was rich and we were arrogant—until an accident changed everything.”*


That’s what we hear from a *Thru the Bible* listener in the country of Turkey. He continues:


*“My injuries were serious and my life has become a living hell. I’m disabled and need the help of other people to go about my daily routines. My parents thought that God was punishing them, and they became very strong followers of Islam. At first, I shared their thoughts—I thought that God had punished us with this disaster and that He would punish us more. My faith was based on fear and I found no joy in life. That was until I heard your program. I don’t know how to explain, but when I listen to your program I feel joy. After one year of listening I have decided to accept Christ as my Lord and Savior. I’m happy. He’s loving me. He forgave me and He will not punish me. He wants to save me. I never felt such love.”*


Praise God. Today let’s pray that more Muslims in Turkey will hear God’s Word and discover His life-changing love.
