 Pray enthusiastically! God is already answering


January 06, 2023




***“And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be******glorified in the Son.”*** - John 14:13

*“Your prayers are making a difference.”*

That’s the good news we hear from Muhanga in Burundi today. He continues:

*“I am a faithful listener of your Bible teaching program, and I feel my heart rejoices with each message you give us. I have been amazed by the prophecies in the books of Revelation and Daniel. Of course, I still have questions on many things that I do not understand in those books, but as I continue to listen, God answers them. I know this is the case for several others in my church too. Please pray for us, and I hope you pray enthusiastically knowing God is already answering you.”* 

How encouraging! As we travel the world on our knees throughout 2023, we invite you to not only pray strategically, but also enthusiastically. Together let’s thank God that He loves to answer our prayers.

**Setting aside rituals and focusing on a relationship with the Lord. That’s the change a listener in Indonesia is making as He studies God’s Word with us. Meet us there next week for more of the story.**
