 Praying Colossians 1:9-10 in Zambia


January 31, 2023




***For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.*** -Colossians 1:9-10

Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today our journey brings us to Zambia where we meet with a fellow Bible Bus passenger named Simon who shares:

*“I am a pastor, and I never knew how amazing Jesus was until I listened to your programs. By this I mean I have very little formal training, but as you have opened up the Bible to me I found a greater love for Him as my knowledge has increased. I thank you for these messages that I share with my church.”* 

Today as we thank God for the change He’s bringing to the lives of all those who study His Word with us, pray specifically for pastors in Africa who are often undertrained and overworked as they care for the spiritual and physical needs of those within their churches. Start by praying Colossians 1:9-10 and see where the Spirit leads you. 

**God’s Word is needed now more than ever in Eritrea. Join us tomorrow as our journey through eastern Africa continues.**
