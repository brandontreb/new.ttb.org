 A message from Steve Shwetz


January 27, 2023




*A special message from Steve Shwetz, THRU the BIBLE host and board chairman:*

Hi, team. Our whirlwind tour around the world in January is coming to an end … but our prayer trek for 2023 is just getting started. Meet us here on Monday and invite your friends to join us as we begin a week-long journey through eastern Africa starting in Sudan. 

Someone recently asked me why they should join the World Prayer Team. I gave them this threefold answer. Maybe it will help give you the words to encourage your friends to join us, too: 

1. Psalm 150 tells us to “praise [the Lord] for His mighty acts.” Do you agree with me that nothing is more amazing than a person (like us) who is dead in their trespasses and sins who then turns to Jesus Christ and is given eternal life? (See Ephesians 2:1.) This is amazing and one of God’s mighty deeds. If you’re on the World Prayer Team, you get a front row seat to these testimonies in almost every World Prayer Today email.  
 **If you want to reinvigorate the praise in your prayer life, join the World Prayer Team!**
2. Do you believe God is at work today? Do you think He could use you for His purposes? As a Christian, nothing is more encouraging to me than to see God’s hand moving in and through a ministry He has allowed me to play a part in. As a World Prayer Team member, we all play a part in what God does through the ministry of THRU the BIBLE. He does this to bring glory to Himself, and it’s thrilling to watch.  
  
**If you want to be encouraged that God is still active, calling people to Himself, join the World Prayer Team.**
3. One of the last recorded things we hear Jesus say before returning to heaven is that we should go and make disciples of all nations (see Matthew 28:19). THRU the BIBLE is doing this on a global scale in over 200 languages and growing.

**If you want to be an active participant in fulfilling Jesus’ great commission, join the World Prayer Team.**

Here’s the bottom line: As a World Prayer Team member, your time investment is minimal; your heart investment will yield much fruit. Sounds like a great way to put yourself in the path where God is moving and blessing our generation. 

**See you Monday.**
