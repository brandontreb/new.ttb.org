 There’s no time to waste in 2023


January 17, 2023




*“I squandered away so many years like a fool. Now I know better, so I will do better. I hope you will too. Let’s not waste any more time in sharing the Good News.”*

That’s the news Sanjay in Maharashtra, India, courageously shares with almost everyone he meets. Here’s the rest of his story:

*“During my youth, I avoided all religion, but Christianity especially. One day I came across your radio program and was surprised by it. Soon I became a regular listener. Slowly God worked in my mind, and I realized that I wasted so many days and years wandering in darkness. I started using my musical talents to praise Him in Christian gatherings and churches. My desire is to listen to the Word and speak the name of Jesus. There are so many people who still need to hear about Him. I want to be a part of that process. When I am finished with this life, I want to hear the words, ‘Well done.’”*

Let’s not waste a moment of time in 2023, either! Pray God opens doors in India to reach the millions who have never heard the precious name of Jesus Christ. Ask Him to help THRU the BIBLE walk through those doors powerfully and effectively this year. And finally, ask God to soften the hearts of those who are about to hear the best news they could ever hope for. 

**God’s Word is finding favor in Yemen. Hear some great stories and pray with us tomorrow.**
