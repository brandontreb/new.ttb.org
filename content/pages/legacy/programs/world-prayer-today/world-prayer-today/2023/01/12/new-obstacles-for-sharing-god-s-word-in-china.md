 New obstacles for sharing God’s Word in China


January 12, 2023




***“These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”*** -John 16:33

The Chinese government has long kept tight reins on both traditional and new media. Over the last year, partners tell us new measures to control the internet, particularly for religious content, place them under tighter scrutiny. As we pray for God to multiply his Word heard on THRU the BIBLE despite these restrictions, let’s also thank Him for listeners like this one who join the Bible Bus every day. 

*“I really love your program. You are the best way to study the Word of God. I like it a lot. As I listen, I feel as if time stands still as I am absorbing His Word and His Spirit. I download the messages; this way I don’t need to worry about missing the broadcast if something should happen with my access to them. Thank you!”*

From the beginning of time, man has plotted against God and His people, but the story is always the same: Victory belongs to our Lord. As we entrust the church in China to Him, we pray you too can find rest in the promise of John 16:33 today.

**Tomorrow we’re praying for God’s Word as it goes out in Algeria. Join us for the journey.**
