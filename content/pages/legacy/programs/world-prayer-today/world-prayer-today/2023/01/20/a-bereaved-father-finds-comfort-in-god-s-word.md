 A bereaved father finds comfort in God’s Word


January 20, 2023




***… Concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus. For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.*** -1 Thessalonians 4:13-17

*“When we know for sure God is with us through all of life’s troubles, we can live by faith and not by fear.”* That’s the encouragement Dr. J. Vernon McGee shares with us in his booklet, [”For Those Who Grieve.”](/docs/default-source/booklets/ttb_for-those-who-grieve.pdf?sfvrsn=cd431f16_2) That’s also the message we recently received from a listener in Nigeria.

*“Were it not for the mercies of God Almighty and His powerful Word, perhaps I would have been lost in grief following the fatal accident that my older daughter experienced December of last year after a hit and run. The motorist violently knocked her down at the bus stop. All the glory be unto God, because your teaching came in very handy as a tool of encouragement to us all throughout the horrible ordeal. We held God’s promises in 1 Thessalonians, 2 Corinthians 1:3, and other verses very closely. Thank you for walking with us through this tragedy and leading us to deeper faith in God.”*

As we pray for God’s Word to be heard by more in Nigeria, let’s stop and take a minute to pray for our brothers and sisters who are grieving today:

*Father, bless Your Word as it goes out today in Nigeria and all over the world. We pray it reaches many who need to hear it, especially those who are brokenhearted. May they hear the Good News and know we don’t have to grieve like those without hope.*

*As they turn to Your Word on the Bible Bus, please wrap them in Your presence and uphold them with Your comfort in their sorrow and distress. We thank You that You are our hope and although we don’t understand the whys of our circumstances, we can trust You even when the pain is deep and the anger overcomes us. We pray Your Word heals hearts and eases pain. In the name of our precious Savior, Jesus, amen.*

**We’ve received precious feedback from Finland. Meet us there on Monday.**
