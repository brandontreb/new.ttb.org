 Praying for the persecuted in Sudan


January 30, 2023




*“It is hard to find good teaching of the Bible. I’ve been struggling for years to understand the Word of God, asking around, searching and looking. But in vain! I’ve prayed for so long to find a place or someone to help me get closer to God’s heart, and finally I came across your program. I feel as though the Lord has heard my desire and fulfilled my longing for Him! The program is absolutely wonderful; the introduction and content are helping me believe that the Bible is there for my guidance and understanding!”* -Faheem in Sudan

Over the last few years, although the attitude and policies of the Sudan government toward Christians have been softening, persecution remains incredibly high. Believers—especially those who are saved out of Islam—are treated like second class citizens and face ostracism by family and society. In some areas they are targets of violent attacks and live in fear.

Today as we pray for God’s Word to bear fruit as it goes out in Sudan, ask the Lord to protect our brothers and sisters like Faheem. Pray the voices of those who seek to harm them are silenced and peace is found within their families and communities. 

**Trained pastors are needed in Zambia. Join us tomorrow as we pray Colossians 1:9-10 across the country.**
