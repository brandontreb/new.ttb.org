 A new year, a new adventure


January 02, 2023




*“Change us by the power of Your Spirit and of Your
Word.”* If you hopped aboard the Bible Bus for our study in
Romans today, you heard Gregg Harris pray this simple and effective prayer for
all of us, including this listener in the Muslim-dominant country of Mali:

*“My
husband rejected me some five years ago. I do practice Islam, but in this state
my husband refuses to let me go; my freedom is forbidden. He nearly destroyed
my work and my life, but God came to my aid. I listen to you through Radio
Sinai, and I want to give my life to the Lord, but I am terrified of also being
rejected by my family. Please help me, what must I do?”*

Join us each Monday through Friday in 2023 as
we travel on our knees through cities, countries, and continents asking God to reach more of His people with His Word
taught on THRU the BIBLE, so they too can see Jesus clearly. 

This
month we’ll take a quick trip through 18 regions as we pray and survey how God’s
Word is reaching those even in the most remote areas. Then in February we’ll
set off for our country-by-country trek, interceding for the hearts and lives
of the people we meet along the way. 

Are
you ready for the adventure to begin? Start today by thanking God for the
opportunity to connect with Him in prayer. Then ask Him to give you His heart
for His people.
