 Better together


January 16, 2023




***Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.*** -Colossians 3:16

When you gather regularly around God’s Word with others, good things happen. That’s what Manny from Argentina shares today. Here’s his story:

*“We are seeing lots of blessings as our church studies with you. Lives have been changed and broken families mended. I read your* [*Notes & Outlines*](/resources/notes-outlines-downloads) *and I share them with the brothers in my church. We are better for having spent time talking and reading God’s Word together. It is very enjoyable to see new members become interested in God’s Word for the first time. Thank you for instructing us. It is my prayer that God will continue to use you as you prepare workers for the preaching of the gospel of Christ. I love you in the Lord, and even though I do not know you personally, you are a spiritual joy to me.”*

Today as we thank God for all those hopping aboard the Bible Bus with us in Argentina, ask God to keep us faithful in meeting together in God’s Word. Whether it’s with our families, friends, a small group at church, or together on the Bible Bus, Manny is right—we truly are better together.

*Father, Your wisdom is beyond what we can understand. Open our minds to Your teaching. Let us receive it and apply it. Place a song of joy and praise in our hearts all day long. Let Your Word guide our actions. Develop us into disciples that glorify You in all we do. Help us strengthen one another and give the glory all to You. In the name of Jesus, amen.*

**Share God’s Word today, there’s no time to waste. That’s what we hear tomorrow in India. We’ll meet you there.**
