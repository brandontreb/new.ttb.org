 Praying against darkness in Algeria


January 13, 2023




***Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.******And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.*** -Genesis 1:3-4

*“The light has risen on us.”*

That’s the good news we recently received from a listener in Algeria. He continues:

*“Greetings from a small village which I will not name. We listen to you on the radio and have received the good news of Jesus Christ. Until we listened to God’s Word with you, we were people sitting in darkness, but now we have seen a great light. We were the ones who were sitting in what many call the shadow of death. Now we want to fervently advance the kingdom of heaven.”*

Isn’t that beautiful? In Genesis 1 we learn that God’s spoken Word separated the light from darkness, and His Word still does that today. Today pray more people in Algeria step out of the shadows and walk with the Light of the world (John 8:12)—God’s Son and our Savior, Jesus Christ.

***“We are better for having spent time talking and reading God’s Word together.”*** **That’s what we hear on Monday as our prayer journey brings us to Argentina. See you there.**
