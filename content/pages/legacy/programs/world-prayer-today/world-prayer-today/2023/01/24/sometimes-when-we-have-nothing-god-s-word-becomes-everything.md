 Sometimes when we have nothing, God’s Word becomes everything


January 24, 2023




***And those who know Your name will put their trust in You;******for You, Lord, have not forsaken those who seek You.*** -Psalm 9:10

Sometimes when we have nothing, God’s Word becomes everything. That’s what we hear today from a listener in Arkansas. She shares:

*“My heart is overwhelmed with gratitude for your studies. This last year has been hard. My husband has left me for another woman, and I am filled with grief and anger. Through your app, I listen to you teach God’s Word while waking, while going to bed, while cooking, while walking. Only in God do I find refuge from the pain. The more I listen, the more I find a reason to praise God despite my circumstances and trust Him that my life is in His hands. Thank you for your faithfulness in helping us draw near to our Father.”*

Today pray for all those on the Bible Bus who are hurting from unmet expectations and unfulfilled dreams. As we seek Him in His Word, may God remind us all that He deeply loves us, that He is trustworthy, and He will never forsake us.

**How is God using His Word in your life? A fellow Bible Bus passenger answers that question tomorrow as we pray our way through western Europe.**
