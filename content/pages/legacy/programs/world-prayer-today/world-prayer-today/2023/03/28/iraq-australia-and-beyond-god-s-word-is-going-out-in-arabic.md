 Iraq, Australia, and beyond … God’s Word is going out in Arabic


March 28, 2023




*“I am from Baghdad, Iraq, and am now living in Australia. I began listening to you and became a Christian more than 10 years ago, but now that I left my home your programs have become more important.”*

That’s what we hear from Jamal as our prayer journey through Oceania continues. Here’s more of his story:

*“Each message is soul refreshing and heart reviving! I can’t go a day without listening at night when laying down to sleep. It was such a relief when I found you in Arabic in Australia. I have told my friends to listen as well. Please keep up your efforts to reach out to the whole world!”*

Praise God His Word is reaching Arabic speaking listeners in Australia, Iraq, and around the world. As THRU the BIBLE goes out today in more than 200 languages, pray more people like Jamal hear it and are saved. 

**Our prayer trek through Oceania continues in Fiji. Come along for the ride.**
