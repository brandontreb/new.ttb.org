 Praying Matthew 4:16 in Saudi Arabia


March 13, 2023




***The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light,******and upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death Light has dawned.*** -Matthew 4:16

Saudi Arabia’s record on religious freedom and human rights is probably the world’s worst. People of faiths other than Islam can live in Saudi Arabia, but they cannot practice their religion openly or even gather together.

That’s why we’re always overjoyed when we hear from fellow THRU the BIBLE listeners like this one:

*“I am originally from Yemen but live in Saudi Arabia. I really enjoy connecting with you via WhatsApp and messenger. The conversations and fellowship are a lifeline to me. My brothers continue to pressure me to renounce my faith and are intense in their efforts. I need lots of prayer. I do not want to leave Jesus, but my daily life would be so much easier if I did.”*

Today as we pray for this brother and all those struggling to live for Jesus in this hostile environment, let’s use Matthew 4:16 as our guide.

Father, thank You for Your Word that is light in the darkness. As we study together, be near to our brothers and sisters who believe in secret and protect those in dangerous regions whose faith is known. Make ways for Saudi Christians to safely meet together and encourage one another. As THRU the BIBLE goes out today, we pray that King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Prince Mohammad bin Salman will see Your great light and bring change throughout their country. May Your Word bring freedom to the oppressed and Saudi Arabia become a place in which Your light dawns.
