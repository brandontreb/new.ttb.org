 A surprise in Micronesia


March 27, 2023




Welcome, World Prayer Team. As our journey through Oceania begins, we rejoice in this letter we received recently from Jean in Jacksonville, Florida. She writes:

*“I have been listening to Dr. McGee since the 1970’s. The Bible Bus is so inspiring. I pray for all the people who write in and pray for salvation and their problems.* 

*“I live alone now, as my five children are grown. My oldest is 64 years old, and most of them still listen to Dr. McGee. My husband died 14 years ago. We were married for 52 years. One of my daughters and son in law are missionaries in Chuuk, Micronesia. Hearing Dr. McGee talking about the missionaries that went to Hawaii and Pacific Islands, they were inspired. Their oldest daughter, Andrea, translates his sermons in the Chuukese language, and it plays on their radio station every Sunday, which reaches most of the outer islands. Thank you for how much you mean to me and my family.”*

Isn’t that great? Today pray for Andrea, her parents, and all the missionaries who are sharing God’s Word in Oceania. Pray their hearts are encouraged, their faith strengthened, and doors be opened to multiply their ministry as they seek to glorify His name throughout the world. 

**From Baghdad to Australia, join us tomorrow as we thank God His Word is going out in Arabic.**
