 Get the inside scoop on the good things happening in Papua New Guinea


March 30, 2023




Good things are happening with God’s Word in Papua New Guinea. Together let’s celebrate this letter from a partner recently sent to Gregg Harris, president of THRU the BIBLE:

*We are excited to announce that things are going well as we begin training to launch THRU the BIBLE in the language of Tok Pisin. This program is going to be a big deal here. There is no other Tok Pisin (they mostly call it Tok Pidgin) systematic Bible teaching. This will be a first in this largely “Christian” nation.*

*In my week here, we have been met by some obstacles. But God is bringing the right people to this project. The first three programs have been scripted, and tomorrow I will hear a production sample.   
   
I could say more, but bottom line: There is good traction here. Let’s pray that all goes well and moves forward smoothly. Pray also for the three to four men we are working with to get this on the air in 2023.*

As we’ve been praying for God’s whole Word to reach His whole world, God has been faithfully opening doors. Let’s join our on-the-ground partners and all who are interceding for THRU the BIBLE in Tok Pisin. As we echo their prayers to move the production along smoothly, let’s also ask God to prepare the hearts of those who will hear His Word taught in a new and life changing way. May a deeper understanding of His Word prompt faith and salvation to this people group.

**“No matter where I’ve gone, God’s Word has always been with me.” That’s what we hear from a displaced listener in New Zealand tomorrow. Don’t miss the great story she shares.**
