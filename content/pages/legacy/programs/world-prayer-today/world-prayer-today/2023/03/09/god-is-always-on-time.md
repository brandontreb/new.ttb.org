 God is always on time


March 09, 2023




***You will keep him in perfect peace,******whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You. Trust in the Lord forever, for in Yah, the Lord, is everlasting strength.*** -Isaiah 26:3-4

*“Humans may not keep up with our needs, but God is always on time.”* That’s the lesson Malee in Thailand learned recently. Here’s her story:

*“Each time I study with you, I am excited. I have learned to trust God as I have learned the stories of how He has taken care of those in the Bible. His people are always provided for.*

*“It is helpful to know that whatever problems we face in our daily life, God goes ahead of us and we can rest in Him. Recently my faith was put to the test when I had to travel alone. I am from a small village, and when I leave, I have much anxiety. As I boarded a plane, I asked God to reassure me that He will lead me and comfort me. I praise Him that He got me through a somewhat confusing journey, and I can definitely say He is my strength. The people I was supposed to meet did not show up on time, but God provided me with the clarity and confidence to handle the situation on my own. This was a lesson I needed, and shortly others arrived to help. With all the suffering in the world, this may seem like a small thing, but to me it was important and God knew that.”*

What a great reminder! God does go before us and gives us His peace when we trust Him.

So, as you pray for more people in Thailand to hear His Word and turn to Him, also think about what has you tied up in knots. A difficult work assignment? A relationship that’s out of sorts? Bills that are piling up? An ever-growing list of to-do’s? Give it all to Him and thank Him that He is our everlasting strength and He will indeed show up on time.

**God speaks; are we listening? That’s the question we ask tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
