 Come boldly before the throne


April 10, 2023




***Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.*** -Hebrews 4:16

Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today our journey brings us to China, where an uncle asks us to pray for his young nephew. He shares:

*“Please pray for my sister and her child who is almost one year old. Since his birth, my nephew has been diagnosed with having many disorders—a heart problem among others. The doctors predicted he wouldn’t live more than three months and if he did he would have many deficiencies. Nearing his first birthday, we celebrate but worry. He seems less capable in many ways compared to others of his age. His immune system is also weak, he seems to be sick more than well. We have no remedy for him but to look up and trust the Lord.”*

Trusting God in the middle of uncertainty and fear is difficult. But as this family reminds us, sometimes it’s not what you know (the outcome to our troubles), but it’s who you know (our gracious Lord). In times like these we can look up, rest in His promises, and know that He is at work on our behalf. 

Boldly let’s come before the Lord on behalf of all those among us who need His grace and mercy in their time of need.

*Lord, we confess that at times it’s easy to feel discouraged when we are afraid and don’t see an immediate answer to our prayers. Thank You for this reminder that just because we don’t see You moving, it doesn’t mean You aren’t. Help us to walk by faith, not sight. Each day at a time. One step at a time. With every breath we take. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

***“I’m getting older and better acquainted with the Lord.” That’s the encouraging story we hear tomorrow in Mongolia. Hop aboard for the journey.***
