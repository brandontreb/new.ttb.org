 “I’m getting older and better acquainted with the Lord”


April 11, 2023




***Wisdom is with aged men,******and with length of days, understanding.*** -Job 12:12

For as long as we are here on earth, God’s work in our lives is never done. That’s the message we hear in His Word, and it’s also the message we hear from a fellow Bible Bus passenger in Mongolia. She says:

*“I am Tungalag, and I am over 70 years old. Since Covid, I have spent a lot of time alone. My children live abroad. I admit sometimes I feel lonely, but not overly sad. Your Bible teaching helps keep my mind and heart active. I often listen to the lessons at midnight. As people get older, their sleep becomes worse. Your programs have become my companion in these times. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I listen to the lesson again. There is much to learn, and I am an eager student. I may be getting older, but I’m thankful to be getting better acquainted with the Lord.”*

Together let’s thank the Lord for all those on the Bible Bus who show us what it means to age with grace and faith.

*Father, thank You for those on the Bible Bus with years of experience and wisdom to share. As they draw near to You, we pray You will open their eyes to see You in new ways. Please bring people into their lives that can benefit from their knowledge and listen to the wonderful stories they share of Your grace in their lives. May Your work through them be fulfilled today. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

**God’s Word isn’t always easily accessible. Pray with us tomorrow.**
