 Pray Psalm 47:8-9 over Western Sahara


April 18, 2023




***God reigns over the nations;******God sits on His holy throne. The princes of the people have gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; He is greatly exalted.*** -Psalm 47:8-9

Our God is King. That’s the good news we cling to today while we travel through the Muslim-dominant nation of Western Sahara and pray for people who many say have little to no chance of ever hearing the gospel.

Together let’s ask God to use His Word to bring about change, knowing He loves the more than 600,000 Saharawi people more than we can ever imagine.

Pray Psalm 47:8-9with us:

*Thank You, Lord, that You reign over nations, that You alone sit on the holy throne. That You alone subdue nations under Your authority and no one or thing can overthrow You. We praise You, Lord, and pray that every man, woman, and child in Western Sahara will hear Your name and be given the opportunity to exalt You. We leave them in Your hands and pray in the name of Jesus, amen.*

**We’re praying Jeremiah 29:13 in Egypt tomorrow. See you there.**
