 God’s Word is breaking through obstacles in Libya


April 21, 2023




If we were to name the top five most dangerous countries to live as a Christian, Libya would undoubtedly make the list. Here’s why:

* 97% of Libyans are Muslim
* Many missionaries and indigenous believers have been killed in recent years
* Sharing the name of Jesus in the country is ruthlessly opposed
* An estimated 20 believers are the only ones left in the country

And yet, God’s powerful Word is breaking through these obstacles. Rejoice in this letter (we don’t receive many from this area) from a listener who calls herself Yamina:

*“I am a woman of prayer, and God has used you to answer many of them. I asked for some company in my faith, and He brought me you. Then I began praying for my neighbor, Nora. She was at first resistant to the name of Jesus. She believed He was an enemy of Muslims. When I explained He is the friend of Muslims, a friend of sinners, but an enemy of sin, she said she would think about it. I asked her to listen to your program with me and then she went home. A few days later she decided to accept Jesus as her Savior! What a miracle. Now we are both students of your teaching and God-willing, our husbands will be, too.”*

Together let’s pray for and praise God for the faith and bravery of Yamina, Nora, and all those who choose to follow Jesus despite the risk.

*Father, thank You, even with the threat of imminent danger, Your name is proclaimed and hearts are drawing close to You. Protect our brothers and sisters in Libya today. Encourage them and strengthen them with Your Word. As THRU the BIBLE goes out, multiply their numbers and change Libya from Muslim-dominant to a country that glorifies You. In the precious name of Jesus, amen.*

**Next week our prayers take us to South America. Come along as we pray our way across the globe on World Prayer Today.**
