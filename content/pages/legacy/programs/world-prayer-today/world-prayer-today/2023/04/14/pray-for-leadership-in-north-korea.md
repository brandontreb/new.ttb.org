 Pray for leadership in North Korea


April 14, 2023




***Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence.***-1 Timothy 2:1-2

Today our journey brings us to one of the darkest and more disturbing countries on earth—North Korea. While there are so many needs within her borders, today let’s concentrate on North Korea’s leadership, particularly, Kim Jong-un.

As 1 Timothy 2:1-2 says, God calls His people to pray for the leaders of our land and the leaders of the nations. As together we pray they will lead quiet, peaceable, godly, and reverent lives, here are a few specifics we can focus on:

1. Pray for the eyes and hearts of Kim Jong-un and all those in authority positions are opened to the beauty of Jesus Christ. Pray they come to believe on His name and experience His mercy and grace.
1. Pray God’s Word and His will may be their main objective and desire.
1. Ask God to bring justice to North Korea and that each person be treated with dignity and kindness.
1. Pray godly leaders in North and South Korea begin to work together to wisely and compassionately govern the people of these lands.**We’ve got good news tomorrow in Algeria. Come meet a new brother in Christ.**
