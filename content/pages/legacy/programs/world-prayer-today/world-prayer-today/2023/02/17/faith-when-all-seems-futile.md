 Faith when all seems futile


February 17, 2023




***Though the fig tree may not blossom,******nor fruit be on the vines; though the labor of the olive may fail, and the fields yield no food; though the flock may be cut off from the fold, and there be no herd in the stalls—yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation. The Lord God is my strength; He will make my feet like deer’s feet, and He will make me walk on my high hills.*** -Habakkuk 3:17-18 

 Imagine working day in, day out at a dangerous job without positive feedback or even knowing if you are making progress. That’s the reality for many of THRU the BIBLE’S team members who share God’s Word around the world. Join as we pray for encouragement for THRU the BIBLE’S Turkmen team who recently shared this update:

 *“We live in a country in which every move we make is monitored and controlled. Unfortunately, people are too afraid to contact us and write to us about what this Bible teaching means to them. Often, messages are censored and don’t reach us, despite the attempts of those who are bold enough to try to connect even with the restrictions. It is a difficult work, but we praise God for the opportunity.”*

Today praise God for those who work tirelessly at getting God’s Word out on THRU the BIBLE in more than 200 languages. Thank Him for their humble hearts that praise Him, even when their efforts seem futile. Pray His Spirit encourages, gives peace in the process, and provides them with excitement as they wait on our mighty God to work all things out for His glory and their good. As Habakkuk learned, though God may seem silent and uninvolved, we can trust He has a plan.

**God sees us even when others don’t. That’s what we hear tomorrow from a listener in Spain. Hop aboard and join us.**
