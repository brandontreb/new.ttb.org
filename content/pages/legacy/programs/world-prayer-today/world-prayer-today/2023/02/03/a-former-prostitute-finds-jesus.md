 A former prostitute finds Jesus


February 03, 2023




***For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.*** -Galatians 3:26

Have you hopped aboard the Bible Bus [today](/programs/the-5-year-study)? If so, you heard Dr. McGee talk about how we can know without a shadow of a doubt that we are a child of God. Emelina in Mozambique recently took her place in what Dr. McGee calls the “household of faith.” Here’s her story:

*“Greetings in the name of Jesus. I need to share with you what God has done. My life has changed. I was very unhappy and committed to prostitution. I used to steal, drink too much alcohol, and participate in idolatry. But God is good. I praise Him for getting me out from evil. I only have praise for using this program to save me and help me walk with Him. I am proudly His daughter and tell everyone I know about my Father in heaven. Thank you for helping me realize no matter what I’ve done or where I’ve been, God welcomes me and loves me.”*

Thank God, we can be certain we are His sons and daughters! Pray more people in Mozambique hear His Word and chose to place their trust in Jesus Christ so that one day we will rejoice together in that great multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb (Revelation 7:9).

**The book of Daniel changed everything for Josue in Nicaragua. Hear his story next time.**
