 Finding certainty in salvation


February 08, 2023




*“God offers eternal life—everlasting life—to those who believe in Jesus Christ. This gift is given the moment you believe, but it continues through eternity. It is not temporary or uncertain or paid out over time. It’s completely yours the moment you trust Jesus Christ.”* - Dr. J. Vernon McGee from [“Rest Assured: Conquering Your Doubts About Your Salvation”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_rest-assured.pdf?sfvrsn=9071e16_4)

Can we be certain that God has saved us? If you’ve ever wrestled with this question, you aren’t alone. Most us at one time or another have doubted our salvation. Dr. McGee struggled for years to answer this for himself and our fellow listener, Ronaldo, in Costa Rica did too. Here’s his story.

*“I have been listening for about a year now and I love it. My pastor taught me how to get on the internet and listen on my mobile phone. I have learned a lot and I recently got baptized. I struggled for a long time, but the more I study God’s Word and get to know Him, the more I feel confident that God has received me. I am a new creature by the grace of God.”*

It’s a joy to pray more people in Costa Rica hop aboard the Bible Bus and learn that they too can trust in God and His promises. Like Ronaldo, as they draw close to Him, ask God to remove their doubts and fears. And, as they begin to fellowship with Him regularly, may the Holy Spirit speak clearly, confirming God’s love and faithfulness for now and always.

**We’re praying for prodigals tomorrow in Honduras. We’ll meet you there.**
