 Pray for vulnerable Christians in Tajikistan


February 16, 2023




***Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.*** -Psalm 119:105

*“I was distraught and didn’t know what to do.”*

That’s the text we recently received from a young believer in Tajikistan. She continued:

*“My family accepted a proposal from a Muslim man for my hand in marriage. I was so afraid. Thank you for your conversations via WhatsApp. Although you did not tell me what to do, you directed me to God’s Word which had the answer. The more I listen to your studies, the more I am amazed at the amount of detail the Bible has to help in life. Please pray for me. I am alone in my faith and my family is angry that I have turned down the proposal. They fear for my future and so do I. Thank you for pointing me to God’s Word for hope. I am trusting particularly in the Psalm that tells me His Word is a light on my path.”*

The majority of Tajik people are Muslim. To leave the faith is difficult at best and dangerous for many. Pray for believers like this one who fear for their future and their place in their family. Together, let’s thank God His Word is a light and hope in times of uncertainty, and thank Him for His Spirit who guides, comforts, and protects those who are most vulnerable.

**It's not easy to have faith when all seems futile. Tomorrow join us as we pray for THRU the BIBLE’S team that ministers to Turkmenistan.**
