 God’s Word is changing hearts and minds in Nicaragua


February 06, 2023




*“I had been going about my life wrong until I heard your teachings on Daniel.”*

That’s what we recently heard from Josue in Nicaragua. Here’s more of his story. 

*“I was trying to impress God with my courage to step away from all the bad things and people in my life, but I was conflicted. I always returned to my sin. Your teaching taught me that Daniel’s actions all came purely out of love for God, that he wanted to please Him more than anything in his life. I really had to examine my motives and realized that maybe I loved these things more than God. These days my mind has changed; I want to have a love like Daniel had for God. I pray for courage that is based out of complete devotion and reverence for Him who has always been faithful and always will be. Thank you for these lessons and giving the Holy Spirit the opportunity to speak to me through them.”*

*Today, pray more people in Nicaragua hear God’s Word on THRU the BIBLE and pursue Him with all their hearts. As we do, let’s also ask Him to help each of us to align our hearts with His, to praise Him for His faithfulness, and to walk with Him each day out of devotion.* 

***God’s message of hope and love is being heard throughout the Caribbean. Meet a listener named Danilo tomorrow and pray with us.***
