 A message of hope and love goes out in the Dutch Caribbean


February 07, 2023




As we soak up the sun and walk along the gorgeous beaches of the Dutch Caribbean, we’re introduced to Danilo who tells us how THRU THE BIBLE has changed his life:

*“Long ago your teaching from Bonaire reached me in my home in my language. Day after day, I started growing in the knowledge of the Lord, until I accepted Him as my only Lord and Savior. Your messages of hope and of love changed everything in my life. I pray you keep sharing God’s Word until the Lord returns.”*

Today as we come before the Father, keep in mind that Christianity in the Dutch Caribbean is often mixed with ritualistic practices and superstitious beliefs. Pray all who hear THRU the BIBLE are drawn to the message of the love and hope found in a relationship with God. As more come to know the real Jesus, may they leave behind dark practices and, like Danilo, be changed forever. 

**Our worldwide prayer trek continues tomorrow in the jungle and on the beaches of Costa Rica. Pack your bags and meet us there.**
