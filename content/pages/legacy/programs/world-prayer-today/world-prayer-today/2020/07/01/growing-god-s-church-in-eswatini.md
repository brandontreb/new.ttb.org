 Growing God’s church in Eswatini


July 01, 2020




If you’ve been on the World Prayer Team very long, you’ve likely traveled with us to the country of Eswatini (also known as Swaziland) several times.

Each time we visit, the difficulties of life here (disease, poverty, malnutrition) can be overwhelming, but the liSwatis’ love for Jesus is always an encouragement.

Today as we land in the capital city of Mbabane, a listener named Thula greets us and shares:

*“*Thru the Bible-Zulu *is our program! I listened with a few friends and church members. Then we decided to start inviting others to join our Bible study group using your teaching to strengthen our knowledge. We are now fifteen members. We are blessed to listen every single day, sharing the Word of God.”*

Praise God for these enthusiastic brothers and sisters. Pray for them as they continue to reach out and invite others to join them, and pray for all those who join us on the Bible Bus each day. May God’s grace and peace be with all of us as we faithfully study His Word.

**We’re praying for prisoners in South Africa tomorrow. Hop aboard and join us.**
