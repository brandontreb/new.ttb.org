 A shut-in in Portugal finds purpose in prayer


July 23, 2020




Welcome to World Prayer Today. With two amputated legs and bedridden after a stroke, it would be easy for Rodrigo to give up on life. But as he tells us, his purpose is as strong as ever.

*“Studying God’s Word* *with you gives me the courage to live. Every day my wife and I listen to the program twice. First online, and soon after we switch to Radio Sovereignty. Portugal needs this program more than ever. My wife and I spend lots of time praying that many people, especially Portuguese youth, will hear it. Studying the Bible will guide their lives and give them hope for the future. Will you join us?”*

What a terrific request. Many experts say Portugal is both financially and spiritually bankrupt. Let’s pray for the youth of this country to hear God’s Word and begin to walk with Him. And let’s pray for all those who are homebound, like Rodrigo. May God’s Word give them the courage to live with purpose and joy.

**Tomorrow we’re praying for Serbians to give up religious customs and traditions and have a relationship with Jesus Christ. Join us on World Prayer Today.**
