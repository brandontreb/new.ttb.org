 A thank you from El Salvador


July 15, 2020




*“May the most-high God pour out His blessings to all who pray and make this program possible.”*

Our interceding team touches down today in what is widely known as “the land of smiles.” That’s the greeting we receive from Esteban, a fellow *Thru the Bible* listener in El Salvador. He continues:

*“As I listen to your teaching, I learn, I reflect, and I meditate. For many years I sought to attend a Bible institute. My greatest disappointment in life was that I couldn’t leave work to go. My family needed the money, and it was my responsibility to feed them. Then I found you. I now understand more of the Bible, and I have begun a small church. I am very happy to know the deepest treasures found in God’s Word and to share them with other people. When we have breakfast, the whole family listens to the daily message and it is truly more than good—it is satisfying. It feeds our spirit in the same way we feed the body. I am happy and grateful to be on this Bible Bus. It is my deepest pleasure to invite others to join me.”*

Praise God for pastors like Esteban who are tending His flock in El Salvador. Today let’s pray God’s Word equips more El Salvadorians to be hands and feet across Central America. And let’s pray He gives each of us opportunity to share what we’re learning, too. 

**Our brothers and sisters in Haiti need our prayers. Join us tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
