 Praying 1 Corinthians 15:58 through Colombia


July 13, 2020




Our journey through Central America begins this week with some inspiring words from a listener in Colombia. He says:

*“I started my Christian life 12 years ago when I came to know Jesus as I listened to* Thru the Bible *each day. Today I am a pastor. I went to school and I graduated, but this ministry continues to be my greatest teacher. It has been a tremendous blessing. Therefore, I want to encourage others who ride the Bible Bus with me. Friends, let’s continue to pray for one another and work for the glory and honor of our Lord Jesus Christ.”*

What great encouragement! Today let’s pray 1 Corinthians 15:58 for one another, ask God to keep us steadfast, immovable, always abounding in His work. 

**We’ll hear another uplifting story tomorrow in Guatemala. Join as we continue to travel the world on our knees.**
