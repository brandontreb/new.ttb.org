 There is no pain like family pain


July 17, 2020




We’ve said it before, but it’s true. There’s no pain like family pain. Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today as we travel through Mexico, a father named Samuel asks us to pray alongside him. He says:

*“I made some bad choices and am gratefully in a process of painful restoration with my family. Through it all, one thing has become clear to me: God’s Word has the answers I need. He is forming my character as I get to know Him more through your studies. Each Bible verse reaches deep into my heart when meditating on them and putting them into practice. Thank you for helping me understand the Bible and therefore know God better. He is the only thing that can bring me through this deep valley. May the Lord bless you abundantly and may His Word keep others from experiencing the pain I have inflicted upon those I love.”*

As you pray today for Samuel’s family, pray for all struggling families in Mexico and around the world. May God’s Word bring hope, healing, and be their guide as they work to love and forgive each other just as He has loved and forgiven each one of us. 

**Our prayer trek continues next week in Southern Europe. We’ll meet you in Croatia on Monday.**
