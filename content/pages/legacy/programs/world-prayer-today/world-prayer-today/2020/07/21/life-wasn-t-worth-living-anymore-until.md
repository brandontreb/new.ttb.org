 “Life wasn’t worth living anymore until...”


July 21, 2020




*“I was depressed. Life wasn’t worth living anymore.”*

As we pray our way through Southern Europe, that’s what we hear from a listener in Montenegro. But his life changed when he heard God’s Word on *Thru the Bible.* Here’s the rest of his story.

*“I am the father of a beautiful family. I have two wonderful daughters and a good, hardworking wife. I’m grateful to God for that, but life was hard for many years. I worked for six years as a technical associate, but the company failed and I lost my job. That began a very difficult period for me. We did not have enough money; I could not provide basic things for my family. My mom helped us as much as she could from her modest pension. But I lost hope, I felt worthless, and shut down. My friend told me God would help me, but I didn’t believe it. I thought if God exists, He wouldn’t be interested in me and my problems. But it wasn’t so. My wife began to listen to some Christian radio programs.* 

*“I began listening with her and loved the part of the day when my wife and I sat and listened to Dr. McGee. Soon everything made sense, and I started to believe God did not leave us, but in fact wants to take care of us. I learned I needed to surrender to Him and trust Him. We also started praying together. Soon, my wife got a job and after a few months, I did too. It was a sign God was answering our prayers. But the greatest blessing for us is that we have met God and we are still getting to know Him better.”*

Praise God that His Word has the power to heal. Pray today more people in Montenegro will hear *Thru the Bible*, especially those suffering from depression and overwhelming circumstances. As they ride the Bible Bus with us, may God’s strength, encouragement, and hope be theirs. May it be yours, too.
