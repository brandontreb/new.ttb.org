 God’s Word is getting out in “the land of a thousand hills”


July 07, 2020




Known as “the land of a thousand hills,” Rwanda’s stunning scenery and friendly citizens make traveling through this landlocked nation a welcome delight.

We’re glad to be here as the World Prayer Team stops in the capital city of Kigali and we meet with a fellow Bible Bus passenger named Jean who tells us his story.

*“One day I listened to your radio program and made the decision to follow Jesus as the Savior of my life. I believed in witchcraft, even participated in those traditional beliefs. But now I am born again, and I won’t turn back. Keep teaching the Word of God, because many are still in darkness. Even some of those who are Christian still worship their ancestors. Pray for their freedom from this evil.”*

Praise God for the freedom we are offered through a relationship with His Son, Jesus Christ. Pray today more people in Rwanda will hear *Thru the Bible* and realize God’s desire to save them. Like Jean, as they become a new creation (and study His Word), may they walk away from the darkness of their sin and dwell in the light of His love.

**A doctor in Tanzania plays *Thru the Bible* in his clinic—join us tomorrow and hear his story.**
