 “I will follow Jesus all the way home.”


July 28, 2020




Known for its red sand beaches, lighthouses, and fertile farmland, those looking for a terrific vacation (including fresh seafood like lobster and mussels) must visit Prince Edward Island.

As our World Prayer journey through Canada continues, we stop on this beautiful island to intercede for God’s Word to reach into hearts and homes with His story of love and extravagant grace. And, as we do, let’s also pray for Canadian listeners like this one:  

*“I am going to be 80 soon, and I am not always able to get out to church on a Sunday. Thankfully the Bible Bus continues to roll on, and I hop aboard to enjoy, learn, and appreciate the ministry of Dr. McGee. These messages have been a lifeline to me over the years through many trials and troubles, especially during the time of my daughter’s illness and death. During those years of decline in health as she struggled to go on, I found much comfort as I listened to Dr. McGee teach and speak honestly of his cancer and other ailments. Through J. Vernon McGee and his straight teaching, I have drawn closer to the Lord Jesus Christ, and I am continually overwhelmed by the great debt I owe to the Lord. For He reached down, pulled me out of the miry clay, saved me, and continually upholds me through all things. Praise God. I will follow Jesus all the way home and pray you will, too.”*

Praise God indeed. May the thought of God’s goodness in your life overwhelm you today, and may we all follow Him home.

**Pray with us tomorrow as together we travel on our knees through the Canadian province of Quebec.**
