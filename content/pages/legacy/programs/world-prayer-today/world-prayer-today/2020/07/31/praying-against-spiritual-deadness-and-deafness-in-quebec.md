 Praying against spiritual deadness and deafness in Quebec


July 31, 2020




While many people in Quebec may not walk through the door of a church, radio and the internet offer a private way to hear God’s Word from the comfort of home—and it’s working.

As we pray our way through French-speaking Quebec today, let’s lift up *Thru the Bible’s* producer, Rejean Joly, who is charged with a difficult task. As one listener tells us:

*“Your teaching of Amos is remarkable. There are so many applicable sermons packed into a short book. I have never heard any of my pastors ever teach from Amos … and that is a shame …* [It is] *small but packed with dynamite as Dr. McGee reveals from all of these ‘minor‘ books.*

*“As a Canadian with French Canadian heritage (my wife as well), we are so pleased by your outreach to Quebec. I spend much time in Quebec in my sales career and for family travel, and I can assure you churches are indeed on every square, but spiritual deadness and deafness are the norm. Please keep praying and sharing God’s Word in this corner of the world.*

*“After 30 years listening to Dr. McGee, it is amazing to see the growth and steadfastness of his vision for getting the Word out to crusty old sinners like myself. God bless you all.”*

May God’s Word heard in French open the eyes and ears of all who hear it. And may the Lord bless the ministry of Rejean and all those who work tirelessly on His behalf in Quebec.

**Our prayers for the world continue next week. Join us on Monday in Indonesia.**
