 Hope for prisoners in South Africa


July 02, 2020




Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we travel on our knees through South Africa, we stop at Vereeniging Prison to meet with a group of listeners that join us on the Bible Bus each day. Here is their story:

*“We are a group in prison that enjoy your programs. We have a lot of time so we’ve listened to many radio programs, but yours is the only one that takes us through each book of the Bible. You have now become our daily teacher. We are currently studying the book of Acts. We are grateful you also reach out to prisoners. Please pray for us to keep this fire of faith burning. It is easy to lose hope, but God’s Word keeps us going.”*

As you pray for these men today, remember all those who rely on God’s Word to get through each day. And as *Thru the Bible* goes out in the languages of Zulu, English, Shona, and Afrikaans, pray many more in South Africa will find the eternal hope found in a relationship with Jesus Christ.

**Our journey through Southern Africa continues as we pray our way through the small country of Lesotho tomorrow.**
