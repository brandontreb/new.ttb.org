 A song of hope from Korea


December 07, 2020




***For I know that my Redeemer lives,******and He shall stand at last on the earth;and after my skin is destroyed, this I know, that in my flesh I shall see God.*** -Job 19:25, 26

How does a faithful man or woman walk with God in the middle of pain and suffering? It’s a difficult question and one Dr. McGee explored with compassion and conviction in our study of the book of Job. Let’s celebrate how God recently used these messages to speak to a listener in Korea.

*“**I sing a song of hope again today! It always challenges me to hear Job’s story, as he never let go of hope even during his despair. I want to hold on to the Lord who always comforts me when I am having difficult times, as Job once did! I realize there aren’t many differences between Job’s troubles back then and the troubles we have in present times, and I choose to trust in Him and know that regardless of my heartache and pain I will see Him and live with Him forever.”*

**We’ve got more to celebrate tomorrow in Ethiopia. Meet us there.**
