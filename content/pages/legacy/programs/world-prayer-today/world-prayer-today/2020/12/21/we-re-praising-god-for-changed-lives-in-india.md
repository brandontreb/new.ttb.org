 We’re praising God for changed lives in India


December 21, 2020




*“I attended church because it made me feel good. I was known as a religious man, but I didn’t understand the Bible. In my heart I was ashamed.”*

That’s what we hear from Jabari, a listener of TTB-Telugu in Andhra Pradesh, India. He continues his story:

*“Many years passed, and one day our pastor decided to place the loudspeaker on top of the church roof so villagers can listen to God’s Word. When I started listening to your messages through the speaker, it completely changed my world. Earlier, my desire was just to be a religious Christian. After listening to the radio programs, I had to check myself and I could see I needed God. I began to be filled with His Word, and I confessed everything before the feet of Jesus and truly accepted Him as my personal Savior. I began to grow in faith and trusted God as my Shepherd, Savior, and heavenly Father rather than making Him just a God of weekly or seasonal Sundays, Christmas, Good Fridays, and others. I pray others like me will do the same. I am now a new person. I once was an empty vessel; now I ask God to send His Spirit to flow through me.”*

Praise God for the power of His Word in our lives. Like Jabari, let’s pray more people in India hear God’s Word on *Thru the Bible* and allow Him to fill their hearts and lives with His goodness and grace.

**We’re still in India tomorrow as we rejoice with a listener in Tamil Nadu. We’ll see you there.**
