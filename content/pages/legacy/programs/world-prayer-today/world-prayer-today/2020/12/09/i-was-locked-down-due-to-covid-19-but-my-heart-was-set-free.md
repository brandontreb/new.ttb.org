 “I was locked down due to Covid-19, but my heart was set free”


December 09, 2020




Our journey of praise continues today as we welcome a brother from Ivory Coast to the family of God. Here’s his story.

*“I say thank you to the Lord of our lives, Almighty God! I live in Bouaké and was in Abidjan during the Covid confinement period. I am in trade and I am constantly moving about and meeting with people. I thought I was going to die, not from the virus but from being stuck in one place.* 

*“It was under these conditions that I discovered* Thru the Bible *in my Bambara language! And with my cell phone, while still listening to the radio, I could record and listen afterwards. The messages on this program have strengthened me. I received hope and gave my life to Jesus. I may have been locked inside, but I feel as though my heart was set free. These messages are so important, thank you for airing them during these troubled times. God bless you abundantly.”*

We’re so glad for this new brother and all those who are drawn by God to His truth. Your prayers are making a difference!

**God’s Word finally makes sense to a believer in Benin. Rejoice with them tomorrow as we travel on our knees.**
