 “We declared we would trust Him with all circumstances … then came Covid-19.”


December 14, 2020




*“When we gave our lives to the Lord, we declared we would trust Him with all circumstances … then came Covid-19.”*

That’s what we hear from a father in Gujarat, India, today as we travel the world on our knees. He continues:

*“After my son became ill and was diagnosed, we were all quarantined. We had nothing to do but sit and wait. His temperature rose and so did our anxiety. We realized then we had to decide if we trust God with our son’s life or not. After one of our heavy conversations, my wife quietly and confidently sat by his side and sang praises to the Lord for His healing power. He then went to the hospital, and we sat at home and listened to your programs, craving to hear God’s promises and find rest in His Word. Little by little our fears subsided and trust in God increased. Our son’s healing journey was up and down, but he was finally released from the hospital and is healthy. We thank God that by His grace we were encouraged in our faith in Jesus Christ during this time.”*

***But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.*** -2 Corinthians 4:7-8

Today praise God for the character and faith He grows in us through the hard times. He is always there when we turn to Him in faith.

**Our journey of praise through India continues tomorrow in Karnataka. See you there.**
