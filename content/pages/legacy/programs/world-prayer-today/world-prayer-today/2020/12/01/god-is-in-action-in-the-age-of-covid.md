 God is in action in the age of Covid


December 01, 2020




**For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly.** -Psalm 84:11

Our journey of prayer and praise continues today as we meet with Milos who listens to *Thru the Bible* in Serbia. Be encouraged as he shares his story.

*"**I have a friend who contracted the Covid-19. He was immediately isolated from all of his family, but God used that situation as an opportunity.* 

*“My friend knew I was a Christian and started calling to ask me numerous questions about God, my faith, and other things every day. His spirit was hungry, and he cried out to God.* *“Not long into our discussions, I suggested he listen to* Thru the Bible. *He listened on the internet almost all day. Dr. McGee’s messages clarified many things to him that were unclear. He came to know the truths from the Holy Scriptures, and through them he came to know God. One evening he prayed with me for God’s forgiveness of sin, and he gave his life to Him. It was such an exciting moment for me. I saw God in action, God who is almighty and who can reverse even the most difficult situations and problems. After three weeks, my friend recovered physically, but spiritually he was a completely new person.* *“God’s grace and His plans are wonderful for us. That’s why I want to encourage you, too, because what you do changes the lives of many people for the better. I hope everyone who hears your teaching will not worry or complain. We should believe in God, that He will change everything because He is powerful and He loves us. Jesus died for us—God gave His Son so we would have eternal life, and He will not deprive us of anything. I am always thanking God for you and for this wonderful Bible teaching. Such things are needed even more by our afflicted country and by people who have lost faith and hope. May God bless you.”*

As we praise God for drawing many to Himself through the recent pandemic, let’s also thank Him for the reality of Psalm 84:11 in our lives. The honor and favor He gives His children and the good things He brings to those who follow Him are treasures to be grateful for each day.

**We’re celebrating God’s goodness all month long. Join us tomorrow as our journey brings us to the U.S.A.**
