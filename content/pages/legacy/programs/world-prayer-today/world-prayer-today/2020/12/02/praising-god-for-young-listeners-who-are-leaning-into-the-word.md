 Praising God for young listeners who are leaning into the Word


December 02, 2020




As we travel together on the Bible Bus, one thing we often hear is that God’s Word is timeless. As we stop in Texas today, a listener name Blake shares that it’s also ageless.

*“I am 11 years old, so I don’t know everything about the Word. I know how Jesus died on the cross to save us from our sins and how God has a plan. When I was about five years old, my dad started to tell me about Him. Now I am a Christian, and I have been baptized. I know God is helping me in the morning because I have been waking up before my alarm and making sure I am where I am supposed to be on time. My dad and I read your World Prayer Today emails, mark the countries on my map, and listen to* Thru the Bible. *Then we pray for the people. I hope everyone hears the Word of God and lives with us forever.”*

Today let’s thank God for Blake and all our young listeners who are leaning into God’s Word and learning His truth. Let’s follow His example and pray more people hear God’s Word on *Thru the Bible* and accept His offer of eternal life through Jesus Christ.

**Join us tomorrow for more praise and celebration in Mongolia.**
