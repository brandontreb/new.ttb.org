 Whew!


December 30, 2020




What a year! As our 2020 prayer trek around the world concludes today, we can’t imagine having done it without you. Thank you for your fellowship and faithfulness … you are a terrific traveling partner!

As we wrap up, we’d love to know: How has God used this journey in your life? Tell us:

* What country/story do you remember praying for this year? Any stand out?
* How did God use this prayer journey in your life? Do you see the world any differently?
* Why would you like to continue and encourage others to join you?

We’d love to hear your stories and share your encouragement with your fellow World Prayer team. Send your comments to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b1f3d8d3ddd4f3c4c2f1e5e5f39fdec3d6).

**Ready to start again? Our 2021 prayer journey around the world begins again right here on World Prayer Today.**
