 “God’s Word finally makes sense”


December 10, 2020




*“I am a believer and wanted to study God’s Word on my own. I felt as though I was believing everything everyone else told me instead of researching it on my own.”*

That’s what a listener in Benin recently told us. Here’s the rest of his story.

*“Fortunately, a friend of mine spoke to me about* Thru the Bible *in my language of Fongbe. I started listening on the radio. At the end of the first program, I took the telephone number and asked to be put in the What’sApp prayer group. How nourishing and wonderful it has been for me to listen to the program twice a day!   
  
“Now when I read the Bible, I compare the Scriptures with your sermons and understand the Word of God very well. This new state of knowledge helps me to know God deeply. It also changed me to be positive in my prayer. May the name of God be glorified for His work.”*

What a great prayer… let’s echo these praises today and thank God for the work He is doing in our lives and the lives of all those who study His Word with us.

**We’re celebrating in Malawi tomorrow. See you there.**
