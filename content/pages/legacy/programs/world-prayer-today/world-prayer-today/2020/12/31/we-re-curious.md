 We’re curious . . .


December 31, 2020




Have you been thinking about what this year of prayer has meant to you? The last several months have changed the world. Has this journey changed you? 

Did you learn something? 

Understand something or someone better? 

When you hear others’ stories, do you see your own any clearer? 

Do you believe God is at work in our world? In your country? In your neighborhood? In your heart? Has your confidence in Him shrunk or swelled?

The funny thing about prayer is, the one who benefits the most is usually the one who prays. We hope that is your story. 

*Thru the Bible* continues to take the whole Word to the whole world because of the prayer commitment of our listening family. We value your partnership in prayer more than anything else. In fact, we count on it in 2021. 

Thank you for your fellowship and faithfulness on this 2020 journey. We can’t wait to hear from you. Every note will be taken to heart and celebrated. 

Send your comments to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d2909b909e9790878192868690fcbda0b5) and together we’ll get the Word out. 

**Ready to begin again? Our 2021 prayer journey begins tomorrow right here on World Prayer Today. Stay on the journey and invite your friends into the blessing of praying together every day.** 

**Until then, may God richly bless you.**
