 Praise God His Word is spreading in the Middle East


December 17, 2020




Although more than 67% of Turkish people have yet to hear the gospel, God’s Word is changing lives here.

Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today as we make our way through this gorgeous country, we stop to talk with Esma who join us on the Bible Bus each day. Here’s her story:  


*“I am 30 years old and as a pharmaceutical representative I visit hospitals during the day, so I spend a lot of time in the car. As a part of my job, I also encounter hundreds of patients. Sometimes I see them crying and am overwhelmed by the despair on their faces and that of their families. It’s so sad, and I feel powerless there’s nothing I can do.* 

*“The only relief I find is listening to the radio in the car as I travel from one destination to the next. I don’t actually have a nice and comfortable life, either. I never really thought about getting married because I had a difficult childhood growing up in the hands of a stepfather who hated me.* 

*“One day I came across your program and I was angry. I didn’t understand why people have to suffer so much. But for some reason, I continued to listen. A few days later I was in the car, and suddenly started to cry. I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior.   
  
“Now I pray for the people I meet who are desperate, and I don’t feel helpless anymore. I feel that I can do something for them, and I do. I know the Lord can and will help them. I pray they find peace in Him. I also have hope in my own life. I have changed my mind about marriage and hope someday to have a family.”*

It’s true—“faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (Romans 10:17). Praise God for that today and thank Him for the work He is doing in our lives and in the lives of our fellow listeners around the world who will hear and respond to God’s message of salvation.

**We’ll be back in Turkey tomorrow as a widower wrestles with faith. Meet us here and rejoice in the outcome.**
