 Pray alongside refugees in the Democratic Republic of Congo


December 16, 2020




**“My Presence will go withyou*,* and I will give you rest.”** -Exodus 33:14

Welcome to World Prayer Today. As our journey of praise and celebration continues this month, we stop in the Democratic Republic of Congo and visit with a listener in a refugee camp who tells us about the importance of this verse to all those who study the Bible with Him.

*“Thank you for your program in our language of Lingala. Listening to the radio has become the main focus for most of us here in the camp. We have heard your teaching on Exodus and have claimed the promise of God to the Israelites in Exodus 33:14 as our own. We thank Him every day that He is with us, and we pray He gives us rest from our troubles. Please join us.  
  
“We have lost everything due to a natural catastrophe that came through the area in April 2020. We do not know what we will do next. Thank you for teaching the Word of God that gives us hope.”*

Yes, praise God for His presence in our lives in both the good and bad times. If you are facing difficulties today, download Dr. McGee’s free digital booklet, [“How to Have Peace in Anxious Times”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_how-to-have-peace-in-anxious-times.pdf?sfvrsn=ff351e16_2) and learn how you receive God’s unexplainable peace.
