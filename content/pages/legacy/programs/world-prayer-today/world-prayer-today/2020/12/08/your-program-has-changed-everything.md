 “Your program has changed everything”


December 08, 2020





As our World Prayer
Team lands in Ethiopia, we meet a new listener of *Thru the Bible* who
tells us:

*“Your program
has changed everything. Although I am not a Christian, I have learned some
amazing things from listening to this radio program. It has made me crosscheck
my thinking about Jesus. I think I have a lot to know about the Bible. I have
decided to follow this radio program and hope you answer the many questions I
have.”*

Praise God for the
many who hear His Word and are drawn to know more. Pray today for those who
have yet to respond in faith to God’s offer of salvation. May people from every
tongue, tribe and nation be reached for His glory.

**A listener from
Ivory Coast is on lockdown, but His heart is set free. Hear his story tomorrow
on World Prayer Today.**
