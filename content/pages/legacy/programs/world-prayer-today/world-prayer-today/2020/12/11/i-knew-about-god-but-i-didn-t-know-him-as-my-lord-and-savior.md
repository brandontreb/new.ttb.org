 “I knew about God, but I didn’t know Him as my Lord and Savior”


December 11, 2020




The celebration of God’s work continues today as we travel through the African country of Malawi. Join us in celebrating the millions of people, like this listener of our Chichewa program, who are coming to Jesus through the teaching of God’s Word and the prayers and invitations of family members and friends.

*“I have learned a lot in this program, and I am still learning the mysteries of God. My understanding of spiritual things changed drastically when I started listening. I thought I knew it all, so when my brother asked me to listen with him, I declined. One day I was at his home waiting for him and he wouldn’t leave until you finished. As I sat somewhat impatiently, I too began to listen. I was transfixed and began to listen every day. Soon I realized I knew about God, but I didn’t know Him as my Lord and Savior. That is when I called my brother and asked him to pray with me. Now as often as we can we listen together.”*

Thank the Lord for those who share His love with others. Let’s lift up these local missionaries today and ask God that more fruit would be growing where they faithfully sow God’s Word. 

**Meet in Gujarat, India, on Monday as we praise God for the health of a family infected with Covid-19.**
