 An amputee prays more hearts will turn to Jesus in Senegal


December 29, 2020




**“If you are a child of God and in a place of suffering, be assured and know that God loves you.” -Dr. J. Vernon McGee**

As we intentionally take the last few days of 2020 to praise God for how He has worked in the lives of *Thru the Bible* listeners this year, it’s good to remember how many choose to follow Him despite their difficulties. Celebrate the steadfast faith of this listener in Senegal, Africa.

*“I once complained about all the small things in life. I was never happy. But after a stroke and having my leg amputated, I was locked in the house and listened to your programs. Now I no longer complain or murmur about my conditions thanks to your teaching of the Word of God. I follow your program twice a day, and I am learning a lot. It is good to know God loves us and, in Christ, no one can beat us! I now live victoriously. My thanks, and I ask you today to pray with me for more people to be healed in their hearts as I have been.”*

What a great request. Let’s remember this request before the Lord and thank Him for the power of His Word in our lives. Pray today for His guidance as we develop new ways to reach more people with the Good News of God’s great love.

**We’re celebrating faithful hearts in Serbia tomorrow. Join us in praising God on World Prayer Today.**
