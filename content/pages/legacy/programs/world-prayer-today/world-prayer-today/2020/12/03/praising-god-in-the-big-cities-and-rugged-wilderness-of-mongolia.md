 Praising God in the big cities and rugged wilderness of Mongolia


December 03, 2020




**Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock.** -Matthew 7:24

Welcome to Mongolia. Today we’re celebrating first-generation Christians who are hearing God’s Word and laying a foundation for their lives and the generations of family members to follow. Like Enkh who shares:

**“***I am a herdsman. I listen to* Thru the Bible *as I watch over my livestock in the pasture. I have heard the Word of God and try to implement some of the things I have been studying into my life. Through your biblical lessons, I have been learning about a humble character and right attitudes. I am examining the ways I live and the ways I treat my family. I now pray constantly as you have shown me the way to speak with God. May He bless you abundantly for this ministry.”*

Praise God for those who hear His Word in big cities and the rugged wilderness. Like Enkh, pray more will choose to build their lives on the truth of God’s Word. 

**We’ve got more to celebrate tomorrow. Invite a friend to join as we travel the world on our knees.**
