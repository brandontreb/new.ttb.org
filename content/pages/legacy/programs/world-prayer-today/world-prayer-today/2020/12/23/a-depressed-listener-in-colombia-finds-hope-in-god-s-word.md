 A depressed listener in Colombia finds hope in God’s Word


December 23, 2020




Today we’re celebrating the changes in our lives when we come to God by faith. Stop and visit with a listener in Colombia. She says:

*“The pandemic has been difficult. My shop has been closed and I cannot find work anywhere. The buses are closed, so there is no means of transportation. I began to be depressed. Thankfully I found a radio I inherited from my mother.* *Meeting you through the radio has brought joy to my life. You have given me inspiration, and I am learning how to grow close to God. I didn’t know Him before the virus shut everything down. I’m beginning to see there are good things that can come out of this horrible time.”*

It’s true—whatever our circumstances, we can rely on God’s promise to make all things work together for our good (Romans 8:28). As you come to Him today, thank Him by faith for doing that in your life and in the lives of our fellow Bible Bus passengers who trust and hope in Him.   
 **We’re celebrating the reality of John 3:16 in Madagascar tomorrow. Travel there on your knees.**
