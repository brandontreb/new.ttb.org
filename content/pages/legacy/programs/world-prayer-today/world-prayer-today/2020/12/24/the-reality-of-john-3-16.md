 The reality of John 3:16


December 24, 2020




***For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten******Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.*** -John 3:16

We’re traveling on our knees through Madagascar today as we, with great joy, welcome a new brother into the family of God. Here’s his story:

*“**I was* *ready to be changed and to commit my life to Jesus. In order to do that, I needed to know how to leave behind my evil ways such as stealing, lying, committing adultery, thinking inappropriately about beautiful women. I knew I had to repent, but I didn’t know how. Thank you for the information and for praying for me. Please continue, as I want to serve God and continue to leave my wrong doings behind me.”*

There is no better time to celebrate God’s gift described in John 3:16. As you prepare to celebrate the gift of Emmanuel, God’s presence in person on earth, also praise Him for this man and all those on the Bible Bus this year who have accepted the gift of His sacrifice for them and His promise of everlasting life. May our hearts and voices sing His praises this season and always. 

**Tomorrow we’ll share Christmas greetings from a listener in Serbia. Celebrate with us and invite a friend along at TTB.org/pray.**
