 There’s a shortage of pastors in Zimbabwe, pray with us


November 13, 2020




It’s been a beautiful and difficult week praying through Eastern Africa, hasn’t it? So many people whom God loves with so many overwhelming needs. Today we end our journey with a stop in Zimbabwe. 

The story here is much the same as throughout the rest of the region. Poverty, disease (about 2,000 people die of HIV/AIDS each month), and political turmoil are a few of the difficulties. But praise God, people are searching for Him. So much so that pastors and church leaders with biblical training are in short supply, and tribal beliefs and false teaching are often mixed with church doctrine.

That’s why we praise God for the opportunity *Thru the Bible* has to teach His Word in the languages of Shona and African English. As one listener tells us:

*“Thank you for the encouragement you give to us. I am a young pastor and I need support. My church is two years old, and it is near the border. We have lots of people coming and going. Your teaching on the Word of God is a great help to me. I share it with my church, and we come together to talk about what we are learning. It has cleared up many misconceptions and gives my warning and admonishments about certain evil practices more legitimacy. I feel as though you are my partner in ministry.”*

What a great letter. It’s a privilege to intercede for this pastor and all those teaching God’s whole Word in Eastern Africa. As we ask for God’s favor in their ministry and personal lives, also pray He uses them to bring healing and reconciliation to the brokenhearted throughout Zimbabwe and beyond.

**It’s time to celebrate! Beginning on Monday, join us here every day until December 31 as we praise God for answered prayers and His goodness in our lives.**
