 Read Psalm 150 and celebrate with us!


November 16, 2020




**Praise the LORD!** **Praise God in His sanctuary;** **Praise Him in His mighty firmament!  
Praise Him for His mighty acts;** **Praise Him according to His excellent greatness!  
Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet;** **Praise Him with the lute and harp!  
Praise Him with the timbrel and dance;  
Praise Him with stringed instruments and flutes!  
Praise Him with loud cymbals;  
Praise Him with clashing cymbals!  
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.  
Praise the LORD!**  
                     -Psalm 150

Praise the Lord! That’s the plan on World Prayer Today from now until the end of the year. Together we’ll travel the world and share stories of the lives changed through His Word and celebrate the way His love and redemption impacts us all. So, make plans to join us for this fast-paced and exciting journey. 

Today we begin in Guatemala as we meet with a group of women who used 2020’s unusual circumstances to their benefit.

*“*Thru the Bible *has been a blessing in my life and many others. This year we had so much time on our hands during quarantine, we formed a Bible study and listened twice a day. If we don’t understand a particular passage or verse, we listen to the same program again. If we understand we move to the next one. We cannot believe how much of the Word of God we actually understand now. Once we began, we couldn’t stop. We have gotten the taste for God’s Word, and now we are hungry for more.”*

Can you relate? As you hop aboard the Bible Bus today for our [study in Zechariah](https://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/custom-player/), pray others will, too.

**Join us tomorrow as the celebration continues in Pakistan.**
