 Welcome a new brother in Yemen


November 02, 2020




***… I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands.*** -Revelation 7:9

As followers of Jesus Christ, we have this glorious moment ahead of us. 

Thanks for praying for more listeners of *Thru the Bible* to join us before the throne and before the Lamb. Our journey today brings us to Yemen as we are so happy to welcome this new brother to the family of God:

*“I now understand that the Bible is true. I’m continuously amazed by Jesus’ sacrifice and have asked Him to accept me and forgive me. Please pray for me to stay close to God.”*

As one of the least evangelized countries on earth, following Jesus in Yemen is difficult. Fewer than 1% are Christians, and those who are discovered to follow Jesus face gruesome persecution. 

Ask the Lord today to increase their numbers and give them the ability to worship freely, grow closer to Him, and mature in their faith. Won’t it be wonderful to stand with a crowd from Yemen before God’s throne? (Read Revelation 7:9 again as you pray.)
