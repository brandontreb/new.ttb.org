 “We did not know a pandemic was coming, but God did, and He prepared us.”


November 23, 2020




**For your Father****knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.** -Matthew 6:8

*“We did not know a pandemic was coming, but God did, and He prepared us.”* That’s what we hear from a pastor in Malwa region of India today. He continues:

*“Our church has not been able to meet because of the lockdown. Nevertheless, the families in our congregation listen every night and study the Word of God using the audio player. It is amazing to hear the Bible in Malvi, our mother tongue. We are assured we can still worship God and be nurtured in the Word even if the church building is closed. This would not have been possible without your Home Groups. I thank God for this teaching during this difficult time.”*

Thank God He knows our needs before we even ask. Praise Him today for providing His Word for these brothers and sisters as well as our own.

**We’re praising God in Yemen tomorrow. Hop aboard and join us.**
