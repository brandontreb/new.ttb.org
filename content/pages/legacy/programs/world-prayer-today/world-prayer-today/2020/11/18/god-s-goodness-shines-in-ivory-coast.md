 God’s goodness shines in Ivory Coast


November 18, 2020




**The Lord your God in your midst, the Mighty One, will save; He will rejoice over you with gladness, He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you with singing.**  -Zephaniah 3:17

A few times in recent years, we’ve traveled through Africa on our knees asking God to use His Word to deliver His people from the darkness and draw of fetishes and occult practices. Today in Ivory Coast, Adama tells us of an answer to these prayers in His life: 

 *"I am glad to say I listen to the programs of*Thru the Bible*. What struck me in these messages is your insistence against idols and especially on fetishes. In my country these are common. Every day I wore amulets to protect me, and I did not want to give up in fear something bad would happen. Some were left to me by my ancestors and others acquired from an Islamic leader.* 

 *“I learned about your program on the advice of a cousin. It seemed each message I listened to emphasized the idols of fetishes or masks. Out of curiosity, I wanted to try to abandon these things to see what would happen.*

 *“One evening after praying with you in the program, I went to bed. I slept and woke up the next day without any problem. I finally understood God is the one who protects. So, I decided to give my life to Jesus. I went to a city to find a pastor to help me get rid of all of my idols. Together we prayed and thanked the Lord that He is mighty to save, even me, a man who lived in darkness. He has quieted my fears with His love, and I am now free of the things I clung to in the past. To God be the glory! I am also grateful to* Thru the Bible *for opening my eyes so I would not die in ignorance.”*

 **Praise God for His work in our lives. What is God teaching you as we journey *Thru the Bible* together? Email us at** [**[email protected]**](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b2f0fbf0fef7f0e7e1f2e6e6f09cddc0d5) **and share your story, and meet us tomorrow in Mexico City.**
