 What do you think of Jesus?


November 27, 2020




*“I’m not a Christian, but I’ve been listening to your program and the Bible is interesting.”*

That’s what we hear from a listener named Sharif as we travel through Algeria today. He continues:

*“I’ve become a regular listener, but I’ve never contacted you before. I wasn’t sure if you talked with non-Christians. I just want to say thank you and also ask you what you think of Jesus. He seems miraculous and different than what I learned in childhood. Thank you for your work.”* 

Praise God for opening the hearts of listeners like Sharif and for the in-country staff who answer emails, calls, texts, and make home visits. Pray God’s Word heard in the Kabyle language changes the hearts of those who listen to it around the world. 

And, today as you come before Him, tell Jesus what *you* think of Him. Let Him know how wonderful He is to you and how grateful you are for His Word and His Spirit in your life.

**Be encouraged by a fellow Bible Bus passenger in Chhattisgarh, India. We’ll travel there next week on World Prayer Today.**
