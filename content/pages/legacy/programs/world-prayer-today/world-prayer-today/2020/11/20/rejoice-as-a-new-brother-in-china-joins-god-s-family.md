 Rejoice as a new brother in China joins God’s family


November 20, 2020




We’ve seen it time and time again, and the excitement is always new—God’s Word does what God intends. 

World Prayer Team, let’s welcome another brother in China to the family of faith. Here’s his story:

*“I am a new Christian and grateful to be a part of your family. I ask God to keep me faithful in joining you each day in the coming five years. Every message is beneficial and informative. Please pray for me. I’m a diabetic, have lost my sight completely, and am going through regular dialysis. May God bless you and your coworkers serving Him. Emmanuel! I am so grateful He is with us.”*

**We’ll have more good news next week as our journey of praise continues. Invite a friend to join the celebration here at TTB.org/pray.**
