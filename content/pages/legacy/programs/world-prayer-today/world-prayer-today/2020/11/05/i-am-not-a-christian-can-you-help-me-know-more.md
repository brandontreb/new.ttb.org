 “I am not a Christian, can you help me know more?”


November 05, 2020




Quick! What’s the first Bible verse that comes to mind? For many, perhaps it’s John 3:16, Jeremiah 29:11, or how about Isaiah 41:10? A listener named Samir in Israel adds Philippians 4:7 to our list. 

***And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.*** -Philippians 4:7

Here’s Samir’s story: 

*“Tuning into a radio station, seeking some entertainment, I heard someone explaining that today’s message will talk about our Savior from the Holy Bible. I really didn’t understand the background of the program, but for some reason I kept on listening. At the end, the presenter caught my attention; he said something about the peace of God that surpasses understanding. This was a new thought. I wrote down the words and the book he mentioned called Philippians. Since then I have memorized them and recite them in my mind all day long. Can you tell me how I can find peace like this? And how it comes from Jesus? I am not a Christian, but can you help me know more?”* 

 Praise God for His Word that captures hearts and minds. Pray today for all those who answer the questions of listeners like Samir and all those hearing about Jesus for the first time. May God’s Spirit continue to draw them close and help them realize their need for peace can only be found in an eternal relationship with Him.

**Pack your bags and join us tomorrow as we pray our way through Lebanon.**
