 Pray for the underground church in Somalia


November 10, 2020




**Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.**  -Galatians 6:2 

As our prayer journey through Eastern Africa continues, we stop to pray for our brothers and sisters in Somalia.

Recent estimates tell us only 100 Christians live in this Muslim-controlled country, and being exposed as a convert to Christianity means life-threatening danger, often leading to execution on the spot.

Praise God His Word is making a difference here. As one listener recently emailed us:

*“Thank you, my brothers, for this teaching. Most of us are a part of the underground church, and* Thru the Bible *in Somali enables our spiritual growth and sustains us. The gospel is growing, spreading to the nearest locations. We pray God will be glorified here in our country.”*

Remember Galatians 6:2 as we bring these family members before the Lord. Ask God to sustain them, encourage them, and protect them. As His Word goes out, may He grow their numbers in incredible ways. While this may seem impossible to man, we know it is absolutely possible with God.

**Life is difficult in Burundi. Travel with us tomorrow as we pray for basic needs and spiritual growth in the lives of those God loves.**
