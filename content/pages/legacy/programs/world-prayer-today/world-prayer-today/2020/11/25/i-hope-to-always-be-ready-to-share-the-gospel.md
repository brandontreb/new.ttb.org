 “I hope to always be ready to share the gospel”


November 25, 2020




As we touch down in Tamil Nadu, India, we praise God for those who faithfully join us each day to dig deeper into His Word. Be encouraged by this story from a fellow Bible Bus passenger:

*“The teaching from Acts 25:23-26 was excellent. Paul before King Agrippa clearly shares about Jesus Christ and the gospel. His goal is not his release but to use the opportunity to win the king for Christ. So, we should always think about the Lord’s kingdom before our own needs. By listening to these messages, I hope to always be ready to share the gospel.”*

As we thank God for the work He is doing in the life of this listener, let’s pray that each of us makes regular Bible study a priority in our lives too. “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord” (Colossians 3:16).

**Our travels take us to Kansas tomorrow. See you there.**
