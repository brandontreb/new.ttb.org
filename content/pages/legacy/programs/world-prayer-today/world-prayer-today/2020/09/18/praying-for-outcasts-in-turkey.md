 Praying for outcasts in Turkey


September 18, 2020




***Surely He scorns the scornful,******but gives grace to the humble.*** -Proverbs 3:34

*“I grew up poor, in a family shamed by society. I was told by many that God did not love people like us and there was no hope.”*

That’s what we hear from Zin, a listener of *Thru the Bible’s* in Turkey. He continues: 

*“I am* *26 years old. My family are Gypsies and have always been shunned. No matter where we lived, people always distanced themselves from us. Our skin color and lifestyle disturbed those we met. For money, our family picked items from the garbage and sold them. I did not have the money to go to school and, as a child, I began to feel like garbage myself.*

*“One day I was listening to your program by accident. You were talking about the love of Jesus. At first, I thought you were talking to selected and rich people. Although I was sure God could never love me, I began to listen regularly. Soon I began to think Jesus was like me. He was homeless, poor, and many people didn’t love Him. I was surprised, and it touched me. I decided to become a follower of Him. Soon I began to pray to go to school, and somehow it worked it out.* 

*“My life began to change after that. I became confident and, although there were still problems, I didn’t feel defeated. Thank you for your programs that give hope and lead to new life. I thank God for the eternal life He has given me, but I also thank Him for the confidence He has given me to live a new life on earth as well. Please pray for my family and others who are outcasts. May God’s Word save them, too.”*

As we pray today, let’s remember Proverbs 3:34 and thank God for His grace for all those humbled by discrimination in Turkey and around the world. Like Zin, may they too find hope and abundant life as they place their trust in His Son, Jesus Christ.
