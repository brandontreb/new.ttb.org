 “The Word of God has always been the answer for His children”


September 02, 2020




***Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”*** -John 14:6

More than 80% of Guyana is covered in tropical rainforests, making it one of the most popular up and coming destinations for eco-tourism. But against this tranquil background lies a troubled history of political instability and interethnic tension.  


Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we pray our way through the capital city of Georgetown, a listener named Natalya asks us to pray alongside her. 

 *“**Thank you for your Bible study. I now realize despite what we experience in the world, the Word of God has always been the answer for His children. This is an important message in these strange days. Since I have been quarantined at home, I receive your teaching as a gift for my life. Now more than ever we must know the Word of God. Many here are oblivious and other religions continue to grow. Please pray for my neighbors and friends to realize Jesus Christ is the only truth they will ever need.”* 

 Natalya is right. While Christianity is the largest religion of Guyana, the number of Guyanese Hindus and Muslims are growing. Today let’s pray for God’s Word to reach into every home across that nation. May all those who hear the name of Jesus believe in the power of His Word recorded in John 14:6. He is the *only* way. His is the *only* truth. He is the *only* way to life. 

 **God’s Word is changing lives in Paraguay. Join us tomorrow as we pray for people listening to *Thru the Bible* in Guarani.**
