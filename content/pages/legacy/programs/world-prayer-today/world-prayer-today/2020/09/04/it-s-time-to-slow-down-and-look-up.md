 It’s time to slow down and look up


September 04, 2020




*“Those who hurry waste their time*.” That’s the popular Patagonian saying that embodies the culture in Chile. 

 So, as we travel through this magnificent country, we slow down, look up, and thank God for all He is doing in the lives of these *Thru the Bible* listeners. 

 Isidora shares: *“Listening to you is an oasis of peace in a controversial world. I have fun with it and at the same time I learn about the marvelous book, the Bible. Thank you for always leading me back to my Savior.”* 

 Augustin texted this: *“I am separate from my wife, and I am lonely. Listening to you makes me feel accompanied, and learning from our Lord Jesus Christ is making me feel patient for her return.”*   
  
From Benjamin and Sarah we hear: *“We are a young couple with two children. We are committed to following the Lord. Listening to your radio program is changing our lives and the way we guide our family. Thank you.”* 

 God is faithful! Join us as we ask Him to continue to open doors and hearts so thousands will hear the name of Jesus Christ in South America. And as you do, pray for people in your neighborhood, too.  

 **Our worldwide journey continues in Southern Asia on Monday. Invite a friend to join us** **here at**[**TTB.org/pray**](http://www.ttb.org/pray)**.**
