 Praying Psalm 34:19 in Syria


September 15, 2020




***Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all.***-Psalm 34:19

Leaving Islam to follow Jesus is a serious decision for Syrians. Experts say it’s among the top ten most persecuted nations on earth, with Christians kidnapped, tortured, and killed for their faith.

As we pray together today, ask God to protect and relieve the suffering of our brothers and sisters in places controlled by rebel groups who oppose Christianity. And pray for those who are discovering Jesus for the first time like Asa who recently emailed us to say:

*“I really want to talk with someone. I need help in my new thoughts and maybe my new faith. I feel lost. I have a million questions and concerns, but when I listen to your program I feel as if Allah is talking directly to me. I haven’t felt this way listening to or reading the Quran. I am worried, but I am also strangely at peace. Is there anyone I can confide in? I want to know more about Jesus.”*

**It’s a privilege to pray alongside you. Meet us tomorrow as we make our way through the heart of Iraq.**
