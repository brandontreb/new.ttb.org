 A drunk and disorderly text leads to a long and fruitful relationship


September 21, 2020




*“Your teaching is all nonsense. I’m off now, it’s time to drink some more*.” 

That’s the text Dmitry from Russia sent during a *Thru the Bible* program. 

Today as we travel through Russia, pray for the opportunity to be used by God to change hearts—especially of those who contact us expressing anger and frustration. Often there’s a lot of them! Together let’s ask God to use these interactions as the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship like it did for Dmitry.

Here’s his next text: *“Thank you for kindly answering my rude text. I have decided to take your advice and study with you to see what really is in God’s Word. I’ll be listening and asking serious questions from now on.”*

**A suicidal listener in Bulgaria meets God on the radio. We’ll share his story tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
