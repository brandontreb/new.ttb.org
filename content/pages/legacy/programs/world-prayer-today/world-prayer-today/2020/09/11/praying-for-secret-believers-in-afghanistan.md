 Praying for secret believers in Afghanistan


September 11, 2020




Welcome, World Prayer Team. As our journey through Southern Asia ends this week we stop in Afghanistan and pray for our brothers and sisters who live in constant fear. 

As you may know, Afghanistan is a tribal society, and loyalty to family, clan tribe, and religion are a matter of life and death. In fact, it’s illegal for an Afghani to leave Islam.

Those who are discovered to be Christians may be sent to a mental hospital—because their families believe no sane person would leave Islam. They may also be beaten or even killed by family members or Islamic extremist groups like the Taliban. 

But despite the violence and intimidation, there may be as many as a few thousand Christians living in secret. It’s for these believers and those who are open to the gospel that we pray today. May the peace and joy found in a relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ offer freedom and hope, and may God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* sustain and encourage them as they follow Him. 

**Grab your passport and join us next week—we’ve got lots to pray about in the Middle East.**
