 “God’s Word is my manual for every situation in life…”


September 03, 2020




 

As the World Prayer Team continues to travel through South America, we join a listener named Linda in praying for young lives in Paraguay. 

*“I first heard your programs when I was 17 years old. I was depressed, and a friend invited me to listen. Within a few days I gave myself completely to the Lord and haven’t stopped studying with you for the last 15 years. Thank you for your teaching. The Bible has become my manual for every situation in life, both good and bad. Through it, I have come to know the Lord is with me in all I do. I can’t think of a more important lesson to learn, so now I am passing it along to youth in my area. Please pray they will hear the truth. May God continue to lead and guide you as you reach out in Paraguay and other areas of the world.”* 

What a great request. Let’s join Linda in asking God to magnify the ministry of His Word in the hearts of Paraguay’s youth and around the world. 

**We’re slowing down and looking up tomorrow in Chile. The journey is worth it!**
