 A listener on the Ivory Coast is praying for you


September 29, 2020




***Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name.***  -Hebrews 13:15

Welcome, World Prayer Team. As our journey through West Africa continues this week, we stop along the Ivory Coast to praise God and pray with a listener named Akissi who offers us great encouragement:

*“As I listen to* Thru the Bible, *I ask the Lord for the opportunity to adapt my life according to His will and expand my understanding of the Scriptures. As I put the Word into practice, I also pray for Him to increase my love for Him. He alone is the light of the world. By His Spirit of wisdom and revelation, I pray to discern the best things, to celebrate the glory of His grace so I will be separated from the world. I also ask God to lead me by His grace to benefit from these teachings, rather than other confusing teachings that are taught in churches across Africa.* 

*“I thank you all for helping us hear His true Word. I leave you with this prayer: May our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ, our Lord, fully bless you. May His face shine upon You. May you live according to His Word always. May you be an instrument of His peace in this weary world and be filled with His Spirit as you share His Word without ceasing.”* 

**We’ll pray for desperate Christian families in Nigeria tomorrow. Please join us.**
