 A suicidal listener in Bulgaria meets God on the radio


September 22, 2020




Today’s stop on our world prayer tour brings us to Bulgaria where a listener named Liliyana shares her story: 

*“After a terrible breakup with my fiancé, I felt unloved and worthless. I wanted to give up. To slip away from this life. A friend knew of my situation and stayed with me for a week or two. Every night she would listen to your programs, and I began to listen with her. Thank you for getting me through a very low time in my life. After listening for a few months, I was reminded that I am precious in God’s eyes. I still listen to the program each evening and feel peace.”*

Praise God for His extravagant love for each one of us. As His Word goes out in Bulgaria and around the world, pray people realize their worth as a child of God because of the riches we have in Jesus Christ. And then may His peace and joy strengthen our lives in Him.

Do you have a story about how God has shown His extravagant love in your life? Email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#703219121c15320503302424325e1f0217).

**We’re praying for God’s people in Ukraine tomorrow. You won’t want to miss it.**
