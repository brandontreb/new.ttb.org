 Know the thrill of answered prayer


May 07, 2020




*“Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.”* -1 John 5:14


One of the joys of being on the World Prayer Team is seeing how God answers our prayers. The letters we receive each day from around the world are a shining testimony that God does indeed hear us and respond. A team member named Jackie from San Diego, California, puts it like this:


*“Prayer has always been a mystery to me. I never knew if my prayers were quite right, or if they mattered. I joined the World Prayer Team in hopes of being more disciplined and discovering joy as I spent time with Lord. And while I did realize both those things, what I didn’t expect was the thrill of seeing Him answer our prayers in the lives of others.*


*“I feel such gladness when I hear the stories of new brothers and sisters joining us, especially from countries like Iran and Iraq. I now pray with confidence, knowing my prayers are aligned with God’s heart.”*


What are you learning as you travel the world on your knees? We’d love to hear your story! Email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fdbf949f9198bf888ebda9a9bfd3928f9a).


And as you pray today, ask the Lord to fill our team with many new members from around the world. 


**Let’s wrap up our week with more praise and prayer tomorrow.**
