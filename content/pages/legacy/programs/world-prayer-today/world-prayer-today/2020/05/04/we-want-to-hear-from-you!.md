 We want to hear from you!


May 04, 2020




 *“I pray because I can’t help myself. I pray because I’m helpless. I pray because the need flows out of me all the time, waking and sleeping. It doesn’t change God. It changes me.”* -C.S. Lewis


Welcome to World Prayer Today. This week as we travel on our knees, we’ll visit with our fellow prayer warriors and rejoice in the work God is doing in *our* hearts as we pray for His Word to reach His whole world. 


Today we stop and meet with Bill who says:


*“I have been a Bible Bus passenger for a long time, since 1987. As I grow older, and sometimes very weary and tired of the daily routine, I feel Satan’s temptation of trying to pull me away from listening to my daily Bible lessons. I often feel as if I’m just going through religious activities and not really growing in the Lord. I bring these feelings to the Lord in my prayers.*


*“However, I’m always lifted up when I read stories from the World Prayer Team. They help me to take the focus off my feelings and to pray for my brothers and sisters around the world. God always has a world prayer story that always lifts my faith, when I need it most. It’s amazing how refreshing it is to hear from other believers about their struggles and faith in the Lord! It makes me repent, to tell the Lord I’m sorry for my poor attitude and unbelief. Of course, the Lord is always gracious! I love when Steve closes a program with: May His mercy, grace, and peace be with you throughout this day. So, I too leave you with the same prayer, believing it with confidence and gratitude.”*


How is God using this prayer journey to draw you closer to Him? We’d love to hear from you. Email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eba98289878ea99e98abbfbfa9c584998c)**.**
