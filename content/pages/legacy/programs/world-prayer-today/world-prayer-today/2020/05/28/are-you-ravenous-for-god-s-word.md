## 
 Are you ravenous for God’s Word?


May 28, 2020




*“I long for Your salvation, O**Lord**, and Your law is my delight.”* -Psalm 119:174


Welcome to Prague. As we explore the gothic architecture of centuries past and walk the Charles Bridge, we stop and meet with a listener named Alena who shares:


*“My husband and I devoured your message on Daniel. Now we are listening to Hebrews. It’s beautifully arranged. In the beginning I thought them to be long-drawn and slow. But now I hunger for this teaching and wish for you to slow down even more. I think God’s Word is like that, the more you read it, the more you want it. We delight in each study. The sweetness of God’s Word stays with us all day. Grace and peace to you my friends.”  

​*  

Pray for more people in the Czech Republic to be attracted to the sweetness of God’s Word. Wherever the name of Jesus is heard today, hearts will respond in faith.


**Tomorrow our prayer journey heads northeast to Latvia. See you there.**
