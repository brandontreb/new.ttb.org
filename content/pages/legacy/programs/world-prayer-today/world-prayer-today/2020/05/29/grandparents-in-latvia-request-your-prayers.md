 Grandparents in Latvia request your prayers


May 29, 2020




With its wide beaches and dense forests, many call Latvia an untouched playground for travelers.


Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we touch down in the city of Riga today, we meet with a listener named Juris who asks for our prayers.


*“My wife and I are regular listeners. We have found peace and joy in understanding the Word of God. However, our adult children do not feel the same. They are busy working and building their families, and they do not think about God or welcome Him in their homes.*


*“Please pray they will change their minds, and that they make a commitment to raise our grandchildren with God at the center of the family. As parents, we only want what is best for them and do not always know how to express this in the right manner.”*


No matter the age, a parent’s heart always beats for the best for his or her children. But Juris is right, sometimes love isn’t received in the manner intended. 


So, today pray for those who patiently wait for loved ones to turn to the Lord. May their love be evident, their discernment keen, and their words be met with open hearts and minds. 


**Our journey of prayer and praise continues next week in Western Africa. Until then, may God bless and keep you.**
