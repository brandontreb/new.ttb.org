 “I gave my life to Christ in a prayer listening to Thru the Bible…”


May 26, 2020




As our prayer tour through Eastern Europe continues, we stop in Romania and rejoice in the difference God’s Word is making in the lives of listeners like Alexandra:  

  

*“I am 71 years old, and I gave my life to Christ in a prayer listening to* Thru the Bible*. I am older and I do not have a car, so having you bring church into my home is a relief. Now I know my sins are forgiven and that when I die, I will go to heaven with the Lord. This brings me such peace. Thank you very much for your work.”* 


Today pray for others in Romania (as well as other areas of the world the Lord brings to mind) to respond to God’s Spirit at work through His Word.


**Tomorrow, we’ll be encouraged by a listener in Hungary. Join us on World Prayer Today.**
