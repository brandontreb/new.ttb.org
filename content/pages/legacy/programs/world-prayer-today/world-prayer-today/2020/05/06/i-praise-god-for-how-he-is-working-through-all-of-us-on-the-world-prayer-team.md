 “I praise God for how he is working through all of us on the World Prayer Team”


May 06, 2020




As we travel the world on our knees, do you look at the map on the daily email or follow our journey on a globe? Our fellow team member, Hope, from Massachusetts has placed a big map on her wall to keep track of our destinations. We’ll let her tell you more:


*“I have a large map of the world on my wall so each time we go to a different country I check out its location. Now I know many more countries and people who live in these places. Thank you that by name I can pray for them and their needs. I praise God for how he is working through* Thru the Bible *and all of us on the team.”*


While we may never meet the brothers and sisters we pray for, it’s a privilege to pray with and for them. Today praise God for the family He brings together through His Word and the opportunity we have to bring their needs to Him.


What does this prayer expedition mean to you? Email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#591b303b353c1b2c2a190d0d1b77362b3e). 


**Come back to pray with us again tomorrow.**
