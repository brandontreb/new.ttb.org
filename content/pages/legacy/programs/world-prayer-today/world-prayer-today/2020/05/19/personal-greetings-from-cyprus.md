 Personal greetings from Cyprus


May 19, 2020




When God’s people pray as His Word goes out, amazing things can happen. Rejoice in these emails from listeners in Cyprus.


From Michael: *“I want to thank you. It’s been 10 years that I have listened to your programs—ever since I lost my wife. You are a great comfort to me. I have found a new purpose for living in Jesus Christ. I can’t thank you enough.”* 


From Antony: *“I am 80 years old, and I started listening to your program two weeks ago. I really like it. I can’t see very well, so I can’t read the Bible. Now I can hear God’s Word and understand it.”*


More than 2,000 years ago, the Apostle Paul and Barnabus traveled this island preaching God’s Word. As we follow in their footsteps, praying as we go, praise God for reaching Michael, Antony, and millions more with His truth. And ask Him to reach many others with the lifechanging message of His mercy and grace.


**Our journey continues tomorrow in Kuwait. Invite a friend to join us here at TTB.org/pray.**
