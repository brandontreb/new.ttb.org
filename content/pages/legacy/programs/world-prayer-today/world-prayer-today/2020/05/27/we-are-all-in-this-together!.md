 “We are all in this together!”


May 27, 2020




*“We are all in this together!”* 


That’s the encouragement we hear from a listener in Hungary today. He continues:


*“It is so comforting to know there are people in this world (even if we are scattered), who love the Lord. We are not separated by earthly boundaries, because we are one in Christ. The body of Christ is above all frontiers, and as His church we are redeemed by His blood. I wish you the power and wisdom of Jesus Christ as you continue your ministry. Your programs sustain and grow me. Bless you, my dear brethren.”*


Let’s echo his words today and also praise God for the work He is doing in hearts and lives of *Thru the Bible* listeners all over the world. Pray more people hear the name of Jesus and join the wonderful family of God.


**Our wild and wonderful journey in prayer continues tomorrow, meet us in Czech Republic.**
