 Praying for the persecuted in Belarus


May 25, 2020




During the Soviet era, religion was outlawed and oppressed in Belarus. Today, Christians are still under laws restricting worship meetings in homes, the size of congregations, new religious schools, and the circulation of religious literature not approved by the state.


Welcome, World Prayer Team. This week as we travel on our knees we’re praying for continued access to God’s Word in Eastern Europe, today specifically in Belarus. For many it’s a lifeline, like this listener named Kiryla explains.


*“I don’t have enough words to express my gratitude to you and the Lord for a chance to hear His Word taught. For two years I haven’t been to church because of my health, so you are my only link to the Lord. Each day your teaching comes through my house like a gentle breeze of fresh air. It keeps my heart at ease and my mind focused on the Lord.*


*“I pray constantly for your ministry to be able to lead many listeners to God. It will happen. Our community in my village is very small. I am the only one who listens to your programs, but as I am able, I do tell others. Please continue on. God’s Word gives me hope and purpose.”*


A hope and a purpose. Isn’t that beautiful? Pray more Belarusians will be given an eternal hope and purpose as they hear God’s truth on *Thru the Bible*. And while we’re at it, let’s pray that for our own family and friends, too.


**Our journey through Eastern Europe continues tomorrow in Romania. We’ll meet you there.**
