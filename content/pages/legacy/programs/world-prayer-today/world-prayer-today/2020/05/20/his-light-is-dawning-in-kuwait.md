 His light is dawning in Kuwait…


May 20, 2020




*“The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has dawned.”* -Matthew 4:16


Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we touch down in Kuwait City today, a listener named Hadi greets us and shares her story:


*“This program is a light to the heart and mind. I experience so much understanding of many life issues when I listen to it. I once had so much darkness, but now that I know Jesus Christ, everything is different. I live in heavenly peace knowing I’m starting to understand how the Lord really wants me to live. Please pray more Kuwaitis will watch your programs and that our country will begin to change because of it.”*


What a great request. As you pray today, praise God for Hadi and others who have come to know Him through His Word. Ask Him to multiply their numbers in Kuwait and around the world.


**And join us tomorrow as we travel to Iran.**
