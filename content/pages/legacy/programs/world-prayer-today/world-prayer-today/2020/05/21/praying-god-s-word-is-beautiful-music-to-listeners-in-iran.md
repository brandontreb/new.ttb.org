 Praying God’s Word is beautiful music to listeners in Iran


May 21, 2020




*“The**Lord**, is my strength and song; He also has become my salvation.”* -Isaiah 12:2


In Iran, all ethnic Persians and those from Muslim backgrounds (even if not practicing) are considered Muslims. Anyone who converts to Christianity faces steep consequences, even death.


Welcome, prayer travelers, as we make our way through Iran today, praying for *Thru the Bible* in the language of Farsi, be encouraged by this letter from a listener who wishes to remain anonymous.


*“I am a musician, and I want to worship in church. Through your programs I found salvation in the Lord, and now I want to praise Him with others. In Iran this is not possible. However, my heart is filled by verses in the Bible that talk of music. Please pray for me and others who are alone. One day it will be different, and God’s people will sing of His glory together.”*


Today lift up this listener and all those who are isolated because of their faith. May Jesus’ presence be felt in their lives and may He be their strength and song.


**We’ll pray through Israel tomorrow on World Prayer Today, see you then.**
