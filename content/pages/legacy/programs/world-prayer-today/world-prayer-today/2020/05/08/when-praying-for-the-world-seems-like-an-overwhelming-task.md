 When praying for the world seems like an overwhelming task


May 08, 2020




Traveling the world on our knees, praying for the nearly three billion who have yet to hear the Good News of Jesus Christ, can be an overwhelming task. Katherine in Wisconsin felt that way until recently. Here’s her story:


*“Learning about the World Prayer Team was an answer to prayer in my life. God tells us in 1 Timothy 2:1-6 that prayers should be made for all men. As much as I longed to obey God’s command, it seemed an overwhelming task.*


*“Thank you for breaking the needs of our world into daily, manageable requests. Now obeying God’s command is a joy.*


*“Participating as a team member has given me a better grasp of world geography and enabled me to identify with Christ’s followers around the globe. Thank you for including testimonies of real people in real places. It is encouraging to see the hand of God at work in hearts of individuals in all circumstances. It is a privilege to pray for other believers, the lost, and the ministry of* Thru the Bible*.”*


**Our prayer journey continues next week in Southern Asia, invite a friend to join us here at [TTB.org/pray](http://www.TTB.org/pray).**


**In the meantime, we’d love to hear how God is challenging you and changing your heart as we pray together, email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6c2e050e00092e191f2c38382e42031e0b).**
