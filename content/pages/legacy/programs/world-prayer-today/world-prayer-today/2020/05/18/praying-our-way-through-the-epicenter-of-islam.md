 Praying our way through the epicenter of Islam


May 18, 2020




Welcome, World Prayer Team. Known as the epicenter of Islam, Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s most oppressive nations. Openly practicing other religions is illegal, and leaving Islam is punishable by death. 


Yet, from a quiet room of his house, a listener named Hamad texted this:  

  

*“I have listened to you for two days. I want to know more about your book, the Bible. We are forbidden to even ask. Thank you for this opportunity to know—maybe—the hidden truth about Christianity.”* 


God is answering our prayers. Keep at it! Ask Him to expand His reach in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East and soften the hearts of those who hear the name of Jesus.  

  

**God’s Word is bringing comfort to listeners in Cyprus. Learn more tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
