 Praying for God’s Holy Word to spread in the Holy Land


May 22, 2020




If you’ve been a member of the World Prayer Team for long, you know broadcasting God’s Word in Israel is not an easy task.


But praise God, *Thru the Bible* in Arabic is changing the lives of listeners like this one:


*“**I’m in love with this program!* Thru the Bible *in Arabic has helped me find many answers for many things in my life. The most important thing I’ve learned is how much God loves me and how to be close to Him. My parents were upset that I have chosen to follow Jesus, but for now they support me. I know this is not the case for many, and I pray for them each day.”*


Today take a moment to praise God for reaching this listener and so many others, and then ask that His Word be effective in reaching millions more in Israel and around the world.


*Father, Thank You for hearing our prayers—we love You and call upon Your name. We pray for those who need you in Israel. Open their hearts so they can be reached with the good news of Your mercy and grace. Thank You that despite the obstacles of man, you continue to provide ways for people to hear of Your Son, Jesus. We pray all those who hear His name will turn to You in faith and repentance. Please strengthen those who are persecuted for their faith, especially those rejected by their family, friends, and neighbors. In the name of Jesus, amen.*


We’re grateful for your partnership as we travel the world on our knees. 


**Join us next week as we pray for *Thru the Bible’s*reachin Eastern Europe.**
