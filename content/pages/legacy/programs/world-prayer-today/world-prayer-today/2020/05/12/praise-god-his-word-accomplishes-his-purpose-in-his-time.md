 Praise God His Word accomplishes His purpose in His time


May 12, 2020




Second class citizens, that’s how many experts describe Christians in Pakistan. This is especially true of women and girls, who can be victims of rape and forced to marry Muslim men.


Welcome to World Prayer Today. As we travel through this land of tall peaks, lush valleys, and distinct heritage, we praise God for listeners like this one:


*“I have been converted by your teaching. Through your programs I have learned so much about God and the gospel of Jesus Christ. Because of my transformation, my family has been interested too. As a woman, I was afraid, but now they listen with me. Please pray my entire family turns to Jesus Christ.”*


Yes! Lift up this family and others in Pakistan who hear God’s Word on *Thru the Bible* in the languages of Urdu and Pashto. Praise God His Word is accomplishing His purpose in His time.


**We’ve got good news from a listener in India tomorrow, hop aboard as we travel to Chhattisgarh.**
