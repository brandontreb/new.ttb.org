 From Iran: “I want to serve the Lord, but I am afraid.”


March 20, 2020




*“How do I obey a government that is against the Lord?”*


That’s what a listener named “Lilly” asks, as we travel on our knees through Iran. She continues:


*“I am grateful for your programs. I am learning about my faith in secret because of the strict laws in our country. I have heard that the Bible requires me to obey the government. Please tell me what to do. I want to serve the Lord, but I am afraid.”*


In Iran, all Persians are considered Muslim. Those converting are considered apostates and face persecution, even death. Intercede for believers like Lilly who are at risk because of their faith in Jesus. 


Pray also for our local ministry teams who answer people’s emails, letters, and phone calls.  Ask God to give them wisdom and discernment as they answer difficult questions and provide spiritual guidance to everyone who gets in touch. 


Finally, thank God that His Word heard in Persian brings encouragement and spiritual maturity to all those who study alongside us. Pray with confidence in God’s promises!


**Next week we’ll pray our way through Middle Africa. Join us on Monday in Cameroon.**
