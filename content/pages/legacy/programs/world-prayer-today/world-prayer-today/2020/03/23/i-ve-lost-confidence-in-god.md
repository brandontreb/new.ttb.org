 “I’ve lost confidence in God…”


March 23, 2020




The Islamic north and the Christian/animist south. That’s how many experts describe the religious division in Cameroon. 


On World Prayer Today, we’re traveling the north *and* the south on our knees, praying for God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* to make a difference in the lives of listeners like this one named Marcel:


*“I thank God for opening my eyes through your messages. I am going through some challenges right now and despair has managed to win my heart. I am afraid to say it, but I lost confidence in God.*


*“I thought He had forgotten me; but through your messages, I know this is not true. I have been reminded that He hears my cries and sees my tears. Since I started to see things from this angle, I trust in God and hope is slowly returning. Thank you for your exhortations and encouragement!”*


Thank God for the power of His Word. Like Marcel, let’s praise Him for the reminder that He sees our hearts and knows our needs.  As we grow to know Him better, pray that burdens of those who follow Him lighten as we put our trust and hope in Jesus Christ.


**We’ve got lots to pray about tomorrow; we’ll meet you in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.**
