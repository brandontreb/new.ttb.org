 “Wherever you go and whatever you do, don’t depart from God’s Word.”


March 02, 2020




Welcome, World Prayer Team! Buckle your seat belts as we take off for this week’s prayer journey through the second largest country in the world, Canada.


As we land in Ottawa, the nation’s capital, we are greeted by Nancy, who shares this encouragement:


*“Eighteen years ago, I ‘stumbled’ across this ministry, and I’ve been aboard the Bible Bus ever since. I learn something new every day, and I’m always surprised by that. I want to encourage our younger team members that the longer I live, the more I discover there is no true, tested, and lasting wisdom apart from that which God has given us through His Word. Wherever you go and whatever you do, don’t depart from it. Stay the course. Stay on the Bible Bus.*


*“I wish I had known this so much earlier. Living by God’s Word is really the easiest route to take in life. Don’t waste your time taking detours or excursions that focus on the pleasures of the world. They only lead to dead ends that are filled with sorrows and heartache.* 


*“Instead, use God’s Word as your roadmap, your guide through life, and you won’t be disappointed. I’ll be praying for you.”*


As we travel on our knees this week, join Nancy in praying for our fellow team members in Canada and around the world. Using Psalm 119 as our guide, pray that we walk in His ways (verse 4) with His Word shining as a lamp to our feet, lighting the path before us (verse 105) and directing our every step (verse 133).  


**Our prayer tour through Canada continues tomorrow, join us as we walk the cobblestoned streets of Quebec.**
