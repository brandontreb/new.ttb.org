 Praying for broken hearts in the Congo


March 24, 2020




Rare wildlife, lush jungles, sparkling rivers … those who have visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) can’t say enough about its beauty and natural resources. But along with these riches have come decades of heartache and human atrocities.


Today as we travel on our knees through Goma, Kinshasa, Linkala, Kongolo, and many other beautiful cities, we’re asking God to use His Word to heal hearts still broken from the decades of violence and terror.


As we do, here are a few things to keep in mind:


* Abject poverty, broken families, and regional strife still affect a large percentage of the population.
* Tribalism and witchcraft (including violent attacks) are still a very present danger.
* Millions of lives are still taken by preventable and/or treatable diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV.


Despite these tremendous difficulties, God’s church is growing, with thanks in part for Christian radio broadcast into hard-to-reach places. As you pray for these needs, also thank God for His grace in the lives of His people and pray for more to hear the name of Jesus Christ and bow before Him as Lord.


**There’s more to pray about in Middle Africa. Tomorrow, join us in Angola.**
