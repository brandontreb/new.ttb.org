 “The only desire I have is to serve the Lord.”


March 04, 2020




***For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.*** -Ephesians 2:10


Google Nova Scotia and the images that fill the screen shout of God’s breathtaking artistry in this region of the world.


Welcome to World Prayer Today. As we travel on our knees through the picturesque fishing villages of Peggy’s Cove in Halifax and the seaside port town of Lunenburg to the infamous high tides in the southwestern Bay of Fundy, we discover that even more splendid than God’s workmanship in creation is the beautiful hearts of His people. This listener named Ashley is a terrific example:


*“I have recently started listening. Your messages are a treasure. With your help, God’s Word has become more precious to me than anything else. I am a college student and the only desire I have is to serve the Lord. I don’t know what that means yet, but I believe Ephesians 2:10 and look forward to seeing His plan unfold for my life.”*


Praise God for the faith of this college student and all those who pray to be used by Him. Ask God to give them the wisdom to hear His voice and the courage to follow wherever He leads.


**Our pray journey through Canada continues tomorrow, we’ll meet in New Brunswick.**
