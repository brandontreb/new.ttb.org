 Have no fear


March 05, 2020




***Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.*** -Isaiah 41:10


Today we visit New Brunswick, Canada, where we’re reminded that no matter the difficulties that come our way, we do not have to fear because God is our strength, the help we need in difficult times. 


Be encouraged by this story from Carol, with us on the Bible Bus:


*“I’ve been on the Bible Bus for many years, but it wasn’t until a recent medical diagnosis that I realized how much God’s Word has become a part of me. As the doctor spoke of what was to come, my mind raced, my heart sunk, I couldn’t catch my breath … but from deep within God’s Word came flooding over me when I needed it most. And the best part is that it stayed with me through my subsequent treatment. I never once felt alone and the words of Isaiah 41:10 became the song my heart repeated over and over and over.*


*“Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to know God’s Word and grow closer to Him. I didn’t know how much I was learning until I was given a test and felt totally unprepared. In the end, I realized God was preparing me all along, and He was there to guide me through it.”*


What wise words. Today, whatever difficult circumstance you face (a job loss, mounting bills, a wayward child, or, like Carol, a scary diagnosis), turn to God’s Word and be reminded that He stands ready to be our help and our strength. And, as we travel on our knees, pray that our fellow listeners in Canada (and around the world) also learn to set aside their fears and rest in the truth that He is with us, upholding us with His righteous hand.
