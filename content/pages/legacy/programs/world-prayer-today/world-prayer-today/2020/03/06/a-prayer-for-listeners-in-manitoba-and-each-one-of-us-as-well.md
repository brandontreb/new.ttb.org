## 
 A prayer for listeners in Manitoba and each one of us as well


March 06, 2020




Hiking, fishing, canoeing, biking … with more than 80 provincial parks, Manitoba is a wonderland for those looking to explore the great outdoors. 


Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we travel on our knees, we’re praying that God’s Word taught on *Thru the Bible* firms up the faith of believers and grows spiritual fruit in the hearts of those who hop aboard the Bible Bus in Manitoba, and each one of us. 


Let’s do it now:


*Thank you, Father, for Your Word that tells us when we draw near to You, You draw near to us. As we study together, help us to know You more, hear You more, and obey You more.*


*Give us knowledge to guard our hearts from wrong influences. Help us not to be deceived or sidetracked by worldly pleasures, but to view everything we do in light of Your promises and sacrifice.*


*Use Your Word for instruction, correction, and guidance in whatever ways we need it. Give us your wisdom and your heart as we serve you today and every day. In Jesus’ name, amen.*


**Our exciting journey continues Monday in Southeastern Asia. Grab a friend and join us here at** **[TTB.org/pray](http://www.TTB.org/pray)****.**
