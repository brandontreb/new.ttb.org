 “After accepting Jesus Christ into our lives, we finally have peace.”


October 13, 2020




In our worldwide prayer journey, one of the things we hear over and over is that people are looking for peace in their countries, in their communities and villages, in their homes, and especially within their hearts.

Today we meet with Salim in Madhya Pradesh, and he tells us how he began to study the Bible and eventually found the peace he desperately sought.

*“I worshipped the gods of my family but found no satisfaction in life. My wife suffered with depression and we began to fight. There was no peace in our home, and I became overwhelmed. I didn’t know what to do. I thought of divorce and on more than one occasion, even suicide.* 

*“Then a man came to our door and told us about Jesus Christ. He said that the only way to have true peace was through a relationship with God. We didn’t believe him, but we were curious. He invited us to come to a meeting at his home. After the first meeting, we went back the next week, and then the next week again. It’s been several months, and our lives are drastically different. We now have a sense of togetherness and an eagerness to know more about God. After accepting Jesus Christ into our lives, we finally have peace. We are also secure in ourselves and our position in life. Our parents do not understand it, but they have seen the changes. Please pray their curiosity turns into a relationship with the Lord, nothing would make us happier.”*

Today praise God He is the rock we can run to when life is more than we can handle. Pray all those who hear His Word turn to Him for His strength, His hope, and ultimately His peace found through a relationship with His Son, Jesus Christ.
