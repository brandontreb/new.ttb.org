 Praying for the Navajo Nation


October 21, 2020




***For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.***-Ephesians 6:12 

 Today we’re traveling on our knees through parts of New Mexico, southeastern Utah, and northern Arizona praying for God to make a way into the hearts of the 332,000 Navajo, or Diné as they call themselves, who make their home on the Navajo Nation. 

 As you know from our previous prayer treks through this region, we don’t receive many letters from people here and cultural barriers feel insurmountable. However, we know God is at work and His Word never returns void. So, today let’s remember Ephesians 6:12 and together ask the Lord to: 

 * Put a desire to seek Him in the hearts of Navajo across the USA
* Remove whatever obstacles the enemy uses to keep them from turning to Him
* Reveal to them who Jesus Christ really is
* Stir up in them a hunger to know God through the reading and study of His Word

**Tomorrow we’re praying in the gorgeous US Virgin Islands. We’re grateful you’re along for the journey.**
