 “How do I know what’s true?”


October 09, 2020




***And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.*** -Jeremiah 29:13 

 *“How do I know what’s true? I asked myself that question so many times.”* 

 That’s what we hear from Gregorio, a listener of *Thru the Bible’s* Spanish programs, as we land in the country of Belize. He continues:

 *“I have heard so many things about Jesus over the years, I became confused. I wanted to read the Bible on my own, but I couldn’t understand it. That’s when I found your programs. Your explanations are simple to understand and make sense. I have learned the superstitions of my family are not godly and have begun to teach them what I am learning. Please pray for us, that God will give us wisdom and understanding as we follow along.”*  


Praise God that all those who seek will find Him. Pray today that more Christians in Belize will hear the entirety of God’s Word and leave their superstitions, paganism, and black magic behind. As the truth is revealed, may their lives and relationships be changed and in time God’s church grow in unity and effectiveness.
