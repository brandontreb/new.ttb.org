 There is always room at God’s table


October 05, 2020




***And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.*** -Acts 2:42

Do a simple Google search and you’ll find a wide range of family traditions from the simple and meaningful (in the Netherlands, family exchange handwritten poems along with gifts during the winter holiday) to the noisy (in Germany, instead of a rehearsal dinner, family and friends travel to the bride’s house with the sole purpose of smashing up a number of porcelain objects. Want to know why? Pull up your browser and type “Polterabend”).

It’s true. Traditions are important. All over the world, people gather to strengthen their connections and pass down their values to the next generation. Today as we touch down in the Dominican Republic, we meet with Elian who tell us about the tradition that’s meaningful to his family.

*“I am 49 years old and each day at noon I leave my computer to listen to* Thru the Bible *and have lunch. My father also did this, and each of my children anxiously awaited the day they could join us, too. Now, if we cannot listen together at lunch, we gather at dinner to discuss what we have learned. Growing in God together with his wife and children is the greatest blessing any man can ask for. I anxiously await the day my grandchildren will join us at the table. Please pray for my family as I pray for yours.”*

Praise God for this family and those who listen to *Thru the Bible* in Dominican Republic. Pray more will join us for the banquet and feast on His Word. Just like Elian, God welcomes more to His table and offers His sons and daughters to pull up a chair. 

**Tomorrow on World Prayer Today we’ll meander the beaches and pray for God’s Word to spread through the Bahamas.**
