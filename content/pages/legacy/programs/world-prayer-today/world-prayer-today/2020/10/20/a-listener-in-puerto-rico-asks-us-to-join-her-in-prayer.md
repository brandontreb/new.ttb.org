 A listener in Puerto Rico asks us to join her in prayer


October 20, 2020




*“Beep! Beep! Beep! That’s the sound I have set on my iPhone so I know it’s time to stop and hop aboard the Bible Bus.”* 

 Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we stop to visit with a listener named Isabel who encourages us to pray for her home of Puerto Rico. She continues:

 *“Puerto is my home, my heart, but for the last 5 years, I have lived in Ohio. For many, many years in Puerto Rico your Spanish language programs blessed me with spiritual growth; after being disconnected all these years in the United States (but not apart from the paths of the Lord), I found you on YouVersion and then online at TTB.org. What a thrill it was for me.*

*“Since then, I have hopped aboard again, and it’s renewing my strength. I will remain seated here, changing from one stop to another on this Bible journey until I arrive at my final destination. Each day I ask the Lord to bless all those who have contributed to such a precious treasure, and now I ask you to pray with me for Puerto Rico. May God’s Word know no boundaries, may it run free and far, and may His Spirit awaken Puerto Rican souls by thousands.”* 

 What a terrific prayer. Let’s echo these words today and ask the Lord to give faith and obedience to His Word in the lives of those who listen to *Thru the Bible* in Spanish. 

 **We’re off to the Navajo Nation tomorrow—your prayers are needed.**
