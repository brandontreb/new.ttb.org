 Praying against poverty in paradise


October 07, 2020




Here’s a fun fact: Grenada (located north of Venezuela in the southern Caribbean) is known as “Spice Island” for its exports of nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon. Rumor has it the air on the Island smells like nutmeg.  

 As we walk along the powdery white sand of Grand Anse Beach and splash in the aquamarine water, we realize despite the rich landscape, extreme poverty (both economic and spiritual) is an increasing problem for the majority Grenadians. To guide us in prayer today, here are a few things to keep in mind:

* More than 45% of households are led by women, as many men search for work abroad.
* Sexual promiscuity and teen pregnancies are widespread.
* Most Grenadians claim to follow Christianity, but many are Christians only in name and do not know the Lord.
* More than 32% of the population lives in poverty, most in rural areas.
* Churches lack vision and unity about how to reach and meet the growing number of needs.

**Thank you for your partnership in prayer. We’ll look forward to joining together tomorrow to intercede for Panama.**
