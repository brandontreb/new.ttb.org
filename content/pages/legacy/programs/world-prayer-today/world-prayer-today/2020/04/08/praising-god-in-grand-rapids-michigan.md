 Praising God in Grand Rapids, Michigan


April 08, 2020




Do you remember the song, “There is a Redeemer?” The lyrics of the chorus say:


*Thank you, oh my Father,  

For giving us Your Son,  

And leaving Your Spirit  

’Til the work on Earth is done.*


That’s exactly what we’re celebrating today with our fellow World Prayer Team members named Anthony and Tina from Grand Rapids, Michigan. They write:


*“We are new listeners and love praying with you. Emotionally, my husband breaks down and cries every time he reads another email. Our passion to serve the Lord is what brings us true happiness.*


*“We have lived the world’s way far too long. We are grateful to have found and enjoy true love through Jesus Christ and the precious blood He redeemed us with.*


*“May God bless you all and may the World Prayer Team family continue growing by leaps and bounds.”*


Thank God for His grace in Anthony and Tina’s lives and praise Him for the work He is doing in your own life. Offer up to Him the sacrifice of praise: *Thank you, Father, for the sacrifice of Your Son and for Your Spirit who is with us until we can be with You.*


**There’s more to celebrate tomorrow. Meet us in Idaho!**
