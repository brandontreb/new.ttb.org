 “I was unmarried and felt worthless.”


April 14, 2020




Today our World Prayer team travels through Mongolia praying for listeners like Orgil, who shares her story:


*“I am 37 and not married. When I was an unbeliever, I always felt worthless.*


*“I was not sent to school as a child, and therefore I did not learn to read or write. I was lost with very low self-confidence. But today things are different: I learned to read and write as an adult, and I started going to church in Darkhan. I later found my way to Bible school and started listening to* Thru the Bible *while there. I now believe in Jesus and am a more confident person in Jesus Christ who loves me and gave Himself for me.* 


*“A friend from church gave me a radio. I’m learning a lot. I know God created me and loves me. I now have confidence. My heart has been healed, and I await the blessings the Lord has in store for me in this life and beyond.”* 


How exciting! Pray more people in Mongolia will discover God’s Word and be introduced to a saving relationship with Him. Through Him, may they find the confidence to live in light of His promises, both for today and eternity.


**The journey continues tomorrow. Travel with us as we pray our way through Taiwan.**
