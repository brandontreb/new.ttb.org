 Praying with confidence in Western Sahara


April 21, 2020




***Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him.*** 1 John 5:14-15


With no feedback or progress reports, it would be easy to assume the broadcasting of God’s Word isn’t making a difference in Western Sahara. 


Yet, if there is one thing we’ve learned as we’ve traveled the world together on our knees, it’s this: God is faithful, and His Word always accomplishes what He wants it to do.


So, prayer warriors, continue to intercede with confidence, knowing that God loves the Saharawi people more than we can imagine. Ask Him to use His Word heard on radio and digital devices to reach people that most experts say have no hope of ever hearing the gospel.


**Our journey through Northern Africa continues tomorrow. Meet us in Egypt.**
