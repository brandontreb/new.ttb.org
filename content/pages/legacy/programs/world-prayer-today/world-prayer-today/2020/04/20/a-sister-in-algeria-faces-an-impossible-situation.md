 A sister in Algeria faces an impossible situation


April 20, 2020




*“I am a Christian woman and face an impossible situation. My family opposes my faith and has arranged for me to marry a Muslim. He is not a bad man, but I want to marry the right person … a man who follows Jesus. Please tell me what to do.”*


Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we travel on our knees through Algeria, we lift up our in-country team who respond to difficult texts, emails, and phone calls like this.  

  

While the answers may not be easy, pray God’s Word provides insight and His Spirit guides them in every conversation. Through their words, may His glory be revealed and His love for His people be evident to all. 


**We’ve got more to pray about tomorrow in Western Sahara. Come along and join us!**
