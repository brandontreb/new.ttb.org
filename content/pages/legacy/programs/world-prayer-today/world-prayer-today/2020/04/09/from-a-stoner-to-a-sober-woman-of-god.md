 From a stoner to a sober woman of God


April 09, 2020




As the World Prayer Team continues our countdown to Resurrection Sunday, we’re excited to celebrate this letter from Jennifer in Idaho. She so eloquently describes God’s grace in saving us, and the power of His Word in our lives.  

  

“*I am so grateful for the teaching of Dr. J. Vernon McGee and* Thru the Bible. *You recently asked your listeners to tell you about the most meaningful passage learned from this program. Last week I celebrated my one-year sobriety anniversary from drug and alcohol addiction.*


*“During the first few months of my recovery journey, Dr. McGee was teaching in Ephesians. He took the Bible Bus along a slow route through the first chapter. It was there that I learned who I am because of my faith in Jesus Christ: I am chosen in love before the foundation of the world according to God’s kind intention. Ephesians tells me Jesus purchased me from the slave market of sin. His grace removed the chains of marijuana and alcohol addiction from my hands and feet. And His forgiveness set me free.*


*“Because I made ruin of my life in the past, and I have nowhere else to go and no one else to turn to for help, and because He loves me so much, I now choose to serve Him. He treats me more kindly than anyone in this life ever has. I need His Word to guide my life daily, and I want to obey Him. Ephesians also says He’s given His Holy Spirit to me as a down payment on my future in heaven.*


*“God’s Word has changed the way I see myself and enabled the Holy Spirit living inside me to change me from a stoner to a sober woman who is growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.”* 


Amen. Praise God for His Word and His personal, kind work in our lives.


**Join us tomorrow as we celebrate Good Friday in Ethiopia.**
