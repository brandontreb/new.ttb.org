 “The hearts of the people in my family are falling like dominoes.”


April 16, 2020




*“Praise God! The hearts of the people in my family are falling like dominoes.”*


That’s the report we hear from one excited listener of our Russian broadcasts in China. She explains:


*“For years, I have been faithfully praying for my family to be open to the Word of God, and there has been very little response. Recently my son-in-law was converted through your program, and now my mother has joined him in listening. She, too, is now a believer!   

  

“We think my daughter and grandchildren will be next. One by one, God is reaching them, and I am so grateful. I know with God, anything is possible, but I’m afraid to say my faith faltered and I wondered if it would ever happen. I pray now for the family members of other believers, that my joy will now become theirs. God is mighty to save!”*


It’s true, God is mighty to save! Are you waiting on a family member or close friend to respond to God’s open invitation to save them? Be encouraged by this story today. And as you pray for your loved one, pray for the loved ones of your fellow listeners as well.


**Tomorrow we’ll travel on our knees beyond closed borders as we pray for God’s Word to be heard in North Korea.**
