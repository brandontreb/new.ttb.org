 “May I know more about your Jesus, please?”


April 22, 2020




Known as the political and economic hub of the Arab world, leaders in Cairo influence the thinking of hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world.


Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we travel on our knees through Egypt today, we thank God that in this powerful city His Spirit is actively at work, strategically moving and drawing people to Himself. As a listener named Ammon tells us:


*“Lately I’ve heard about your program several times. It seemed many people from different parts of my life were telling me about it. At first I thought this strange, but decided to listen. I am a Muslim, and your thinking is very different than mine. But your Bible seems attractive. It speaks to the soul and mind. May I know more about your Jesus, please?”*


Yes, we’d love to tell you, Ammon. Isn’t that wonderful! Praise God for His Word at work in Egypt, and thank Him for the work He is doing in our lives as well.


**Keep praying that more listeners will hear God’s Word and respond in faith, and join us back here tomorrow as we travel on our knees to Tunisia.**
