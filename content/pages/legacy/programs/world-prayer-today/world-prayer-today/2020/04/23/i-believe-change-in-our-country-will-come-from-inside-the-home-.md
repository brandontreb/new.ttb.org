 “I believe change in our country will come from inside the home.”


April 23, 2020




Welcome to Tunisia, a land where church fathers such as Saint Augustine, Tertullian, and Cyprian developed Christian theology more than 2000 years ago. 


Today, however, Christians make up barely 0.25% of the population, and face persecution from family and friends. As one woman who wishes to remain anonymous shares:


*“Some Christians are persecuted by their families, especially young people who accept Jesus. And women are often beaten by their husbands, because everyone leaving Islam brings shame upon a family.* 


*“Many of these women are not allowed to leave the house. Christian broadcasts become our only connection to the church and especially to the Lord. Please pray for us. I believe change in our country will come from inside the home. As more people learn about Jesus and teach their children His ways, our country can slowly change.”*


Praise God for this brave woman and fellow brothers and sisters like her who endure hardship for their faith in Jesus. Join her in praying that *Thru the Bible* reaches into more homes in Tunisia, bringing change to individuals and families, and ultimately returning Tunisia to the deep spiritual roots planted by faithful believers so long ago. 


**Libya is our final stop in Northern Africa this week. Join us as we pray for fellow believers in one of the most restrictive countries in the world.**
