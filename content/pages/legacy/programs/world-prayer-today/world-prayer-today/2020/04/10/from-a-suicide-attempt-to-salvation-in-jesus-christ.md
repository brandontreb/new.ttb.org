 From a suicide attempt to salvation in Jesus Christ


April 10, 2020




***Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.*** -2 Corinthians 5:17


Happy Good Friday, World Prayer Team! It’s been a terrific week of praise and celebration. Today we travel on our knees to Ethiopia where God’s Word is changing the lives of listeners like this one:


*“Thank you for encouraging us not to lose hope. I was depressed for several years and tried to take my own life. Several people who are called ‘prophets’ in my area came to pray over me. None of it helped. That’s when I heard your program about the hope we can find in Jesus Christ and the everlasting life we are offered through His sacrifice on the cross.*


*“Although I was not immediately cured, I felt different every time I listened. Gradually my thoughts changed as I began to know God. Your explanations were true, I began to feel like a new creature. One with a different purpose and meaningful life.”*


As Resurrection Sunday approaches, pray more people come to know Jesus and be transformed by the power of God’s Word. Also pray that each of us find the purpose for which we have been created—to glorify Him in all we do.


**Our journey of prayer and praise continues next week in Eastern Asia. Come along and join us!**
