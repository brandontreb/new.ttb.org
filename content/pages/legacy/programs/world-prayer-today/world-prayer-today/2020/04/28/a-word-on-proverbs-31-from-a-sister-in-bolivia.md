 A word on Proverbs 31 from a sister in Bolivia


April 28, 2020




***She opens her mouth with wisdom, and on her tongue is the law of kindness.*** -Proverbs 31:26


As the Bible Bus travels the world today, lives are being changed as people hear the truth and believe in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Here’s a letter from a listener in Bolivia telling us what God is teaching her:


*“As a girl growing up in a household of boys, I heard all sorts of interpretations of what God’s Word requires of me.* 


*“That’s why I appreciate your teaching of the Bible. The recent study of Proverbs led me to spend more time in chapter 31 and really listen to what God was saying. I was challenged, comforted, encouraged, and upheld. My favorite verse was 26. I now desire to spend more time in God’s Word and in prayer, seeking His wisdom and learning to only speak in kindness to those around me.”*


What a great letter. As you bow your head today, please lift up those who hear *Thru the Bible* in Spanish, Low German, and the native language of Quechua in Bolivia. And then, email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and tell us what you are learning as we study God’s Word together. We’d love to hear your story, too.


**Our adventures in prayer continue tomorrow. Join us in Argentina.**
