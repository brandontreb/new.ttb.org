 Praying for God’s name to be praised in North Korea


April 17, 2020




When Christians in North Korea are discovered, they face a frightening consequence. Many are arrested. Some are taken to labor camps or even killed on the spot. So it may be surprising to hear that in a country of 25 million very repressed people, more than 300,000 people choose to secretly follow Jesus. 


As we travel on our knees beyond the heavily guarded borders of North Korea, we join these brothers and sisters in confidently expecting that one day God’s name will be publicly praised, and His people will be free. 


Join us, won’t you?


*Heavenly Father, thank you that in the darkest of places Your light shines brighter. We’re grateful You are already at work, bearing fruit in the lives of Your people in North Korea and in Your Word that is able to break through any man-made barriers.* 


*In a land of extremes and imprisonment, we pray North Koreans will find the freedom found in a relationship with your Son, Jesus Christ. Lord, we know life here is difficult—perhaps for some, even unbearable—so we’re grateful for Your promise that Your yoke is easy and Your burden is light. May each man, woman, and child find the mysterious joy, contentment, and peace that can be found only in You.* 


*Lord, we trust in Your plan and look forward to the day Your people can worship You loudly and proudly, in public and in private, in every corner of North Korea. We await the day Your glory will be known and Your name is praised. In the mighty name of Jesus we pray, amen.*


**We head to Northern Africa next week for more prayer stops and visits with brothers and sisters on this worldwide prayer journey.**
