 Praying for the unemployed


June 15, 2020




***Whenever I am afraid,******I will trust in You.*** -Psalm 56:3   


Welcome to Ohio. As we pray our way through the United States this week, our journey begins by meeting with Allan who says: 

 *“I try to live a holy life, but I need to do better. If it is not too much for me to ask, please pray for me. I want to live in a way that pleases God and I need to find suitable work again, before my savings run out. I serve at my church and with a nursing home ministry. I’m trying to give God my all, including my finances and cares of life. God is everything to me. Sometimes I seem to be in a dry, deserted, desperate place, yet I know God cares for me. The Holy Spirit seems to tell me that if I take care of God’s business first, He’ll take care of mine. I really believe this is true.”*

Today ask God to provide for all those who face unemployment. Like Allan, may they seek to know the Lord in a deeper way and entrust Him with every concern. 

And no matter the difficult and dry times we all encounter, may we look to God to sustain us and write a story of faith through our lives. 

**Grab your sunscreen and meet us on your knees in Puerto Rico tomorrow.**
