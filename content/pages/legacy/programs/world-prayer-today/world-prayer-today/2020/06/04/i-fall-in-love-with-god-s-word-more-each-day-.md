 “I fall in love with God’s Word more each day.”


June 04, 2020




“I fall in love with God’s Word more each day.”


Welcome, World Prayer Team, that’s the good news we hear from a listener named Aaron in Senegal. He continues:


*“My family is Muslim and do not know that I listen to your teaching. I found your programs in my language of Pular, and I listen daily. At first I was upset that it was so different from what I was taught, but each day I learn something new that lingers in my mind. Please send me a Bible. Thank you for all you do.”*


Praise God! Today let’s pray for all Muslims in Senegal and Western Africa to hear God’s Word and be changed. While we’re at it, let’s also lift up Sankare Adramane, *Thru the Bible’s* producer in the language of Pular, as he follows up with listeners like Aaron in this difficult region.


**Tomorrow we’ll be praying for God’s Word to change lives in Niger. Hop aboard and join us.**
