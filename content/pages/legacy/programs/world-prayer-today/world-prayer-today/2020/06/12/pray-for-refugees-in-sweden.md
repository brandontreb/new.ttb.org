 Pray for refugees in Sweden


June 12, 2020




***“For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.”*** -Philippians 3:20 

 Home to the largest number of refugees in the world, Sweden gives newcomers full access to welfare, voting rights, and offers citizenship in a span of five years.  

 Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we pray our way through Northern Europe this week, our final stop is back in Sweden where we’re asking God to expand the reach of *Thru the Bible* programs in the languages of Persian, Hindi, Albanian, Arabic, Turkish, and Somali. 

 Let’s pray now.

*Father, thank You for the opportunity so many refugees have found to build a new life in Sweden. We know many are lonely, scared, tired, and worried about beginning again in a foreign land.* 

*We pray Your Word heard on* Thru the Bible *finds its way to them today. And as they listen, fill them with the knowledge of Your truth, the wisdom to believe, and the courage to step out in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. They may feel lost—like a people without a home. But those who know You, know that ultimately our citizenship is in heaven with You. We ask, Lord, that we get to bring many of these refugees with us into Your presence. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

**Next week we’re praying and praising God in the USA. We’ll meet you there.**
