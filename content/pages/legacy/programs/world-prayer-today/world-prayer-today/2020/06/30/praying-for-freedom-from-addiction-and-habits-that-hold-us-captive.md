 Praying for freedom from addiction and habits that hold us captive


June 30, 2020




***“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.”*** -2 Corinthians 5:17

Does the world seem smaller as we travel together on our knees? Perhaps this prayer request from a listener in Botswana reminds you of someone you know and love, perhaps even yourself:

*“Greetings. I heard your program in my language of Shona when l was tuning in my small radio. From that day, l kept on listening and the Word is full of power. I have given my life to Jesus but have a lot of questions. Will you pray for me? Also please pray that I can overcome my drinking and smoking habit; I would like to start a new life and build bridges with family I have discarded in the past. I have heard you say in Christ we become a new creation. That’s what I want. I want to start over.”*

God’s Word *is* powerful! Today pray for all those who hear God’s Word in Botswana, to give their lives to Jesus Christ and become new creations. As they follow Him each day, may they be free from the habits and addictions that hold them captive. That’s a good prayer to pray for all of us. 

**Have you heard of the country called Eswatini? We’ll meet and pray there tomorrow.**
