 Gladys from Puerto Rico: “Will the team pray with me?”


June 16, 2020




Welcome to Puerto Rico. As we travel the sun washed shorelines and dip our toes in gorgeous blue water, we meet a fellow Bible Bus passenger named Gladys who asks us to pray for her.  

 *“Please pray for my beloved Puerto Rico. In recent years, hurricanes and earthquakes have rocked us and our people are looking for a place to put their hope and trust. I tell everyone I know about* Thru the Bible *and the blessings I have received from understanding God’s Word, but one person is not enough. Will the team pray with me? I love praying alongside you as we travel the world, I’m hoping now my fellow team members will lift up the lovely people of Puerto Rico.”* 

 It’s a pleasure and privilege to join with Gladys today and ask that more Puerto Ricans hear God’s Word on *Thru the Bible*. As God’s truth is taught, may each man, woman, and child on this beautiful island realize their need for a Savior and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. 

 **A father clings to idols, while his family prays. Hear the rest of this story tomorrow as we travel to Texas.**
