 “I trust God to get me through this unbearable sorrow”


June 24, 2020




*“My younger brother has suddenly died, and I have been asked to speak at his service. I am the only Christian in our family. Please pray for me, please pray for my family. Please pray that God’s presence is undeniable.”*

That’s what a listener named Juliette asks as we travel through France. She continues:

*“When I started listening to* Thru the Bible *last year, I was curious. I had no idea how much my life would change. Since that time, I have accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior and listen every day. It’s crazy now to think that God was preparing me for the hardest task of my life. My brother was my best friend and living without him makes no sense. But I trust God’s plan and I trust Him to get me through this unbearable sorrow. My hope is that somehow, some way, God will break through my family’s reluctance and objections to Him.”*

Intercede today for Juliette’s family and all those facing heartbreaking loss. Pray that God’s comfort and peace are evident, drawing them to the hope only found in a relationship with Jesus Christ. 

And, as we gather together on our knees, know that if you are facing pain and difficulty in your life, too, God is with you. His love is unfailing, and His power is enough for whatever you need. Trust Him now with every concern.
