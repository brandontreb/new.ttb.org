 We’re just getting started!


January 31, 2020




Congratulations, World Prayer Team! We made it around the world in one month. But don’t unpack your bags yet! 


Take a good, long rest this weekend, and on Monday the journey begins again! Don’t miss a day as we spend the week praying in Eastern Africa for five different countries and *Thru the Bible* programs in five different languages. 


Where are you looking forward to travelling on your knees this year? Email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#32707b707e77706761726666701c5d4055) and tell us why. We love to hear from you and about how God is changing your life as a result of praying for His whole Word to reach His whole world. So be in touch today, won’t you?


And don’t forget we also want to help you walk alongside those in your life who don’t know the Lord. To direct them to our studies online, visit [TTB.org](http://www.ttb.org) and click on the orange “listen” button. Or if you need help sharing the gospel, we have several [downloadable resources](http://www.ttb.org/salvation) outlining God’s offer of salvation. The best part is, all of them follow Dr. McGee’s down to earth and easy to understand teaching style, and they are free!


It’s our greatest privilege to pray for and with you. This weekend, intercede for one another. Ask God to strengthen our fellow team members, to encourage them through His Word, and give them opportunities to share the Good News with that one He puts in their path. May God do these things in our lives, too.


**See you on Monday!**
