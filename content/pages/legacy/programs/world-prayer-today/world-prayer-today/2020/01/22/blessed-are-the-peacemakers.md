 Blessed are the peacemakers


January 22, 2020




As we touch down in Eastern Europe, we meet a listener of our Russian programs named Dmitri. He’s excited to see us and has a lot to share about his life:


*“My father drank too much. He often beat my mother and humiliated me and my siblings. As a teenager I stopped talking to him and soon after I moved out and cut ties with him altogether. I went on to study at a university and have a life of my own. However, I was a very angry man.* 


*“One day a neighbor told me about your programs. I began to listen and my life changed. I found peace and joy. I listened to your programs on forgiveness and began to think I should put my relationship with my father in order. I found it hard to forgive, but I tried. I just couldn’t do it. Then I realized that I needed the Lord to do it for me. I prayed and asked Him to help me.* 


*“A little at a time, I felt my heart begin to ease. Today our relationship is better, but still difficult. I try to remember that God calls me to be a peacemaker. I pray that other listeners will find it in their hearts to do the same. May we all be a reflection of God’s peace in this vengeful world.”*


Isn’t that beautiful? Is there someone you need to make peace with too? To echo Dmitri, ask God to help us reflect the life of Jesus to the world. And ask the Lord for favor as *Thru the Bible* is heard in Eastern Europe. 


Some say that Eastern Europe is spiritually dead. We know that’s not true—that the Lord is accomplishing His purposes in people’s hearts as they hear and respond to His Word. 


Pray for God’s will to be done in these spiritually isolated countries. 


**We’ve got another exciting journey tomorrow—come along as we pray our way through** **Western Africa.**
