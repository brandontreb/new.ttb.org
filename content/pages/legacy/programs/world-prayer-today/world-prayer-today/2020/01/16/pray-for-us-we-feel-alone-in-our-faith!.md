 “Pray for us, we feel alone in our faith!”


January 16, 2020




*“I live in the high mountains and it is hard being a Christian in this region. Pray for us, we often feel alone in our faith!”*


That’s the message we recently received from a listener of our ​Taqbaylit broadcasts. 


Welcome to World Prayer Today. As our journey takes us through the countries of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and Western Sahara, join together in praying for this listener and the thousands of others in Northern Africa who feel isolated and alone.


Pray that God’s Word taught on *Thru the Bible* fills followers of Jesus Christ with a sense of nearness to the Lord and helps them feel connected to the family of God, locally and worldwide. Pray also with confidence, that God’s will be done in their lives and in this region that is so encased in spiritual darkness. 


Believe this: *For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.* -Ephesians 6:12


**It’s a privilege to pray alongside you. Join us tomorrow as we travel through South America.**
