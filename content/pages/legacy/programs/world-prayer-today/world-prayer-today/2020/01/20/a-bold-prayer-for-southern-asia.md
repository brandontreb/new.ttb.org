 A bold prayer for Southern Asia


January 20, 2020




From the snowy ridges of the Himalayas to the sapphire coasts of the Maldives, Southern Asia is the destination of choice for travelers from around the world.


But tourists who look beyond the breathtaking beauty quickly notice much more to pray about. Many nations here are among the poorest in the world, and several severely limit Christians from sharing their faith. In fact, experts say that without a miracle, millions here will live their lives without hearing the gospel even once.


We know God has opened doors of communication with these areas more in recent years than at any other time in history. 


Today, pray specifically for *Thru the Bible* Home Groups gathering in Nepal. Pray that people’s young faiths will be strengthened by understanding God’s Word. Intercede for those in trouble with government authorities or ostracized by their families because of their faith in Jesus Christ. Pray they will be given great joy in their relationship with Jesus and peace in spite of conflict. Be their intercessors today.  


May every man, woman, and child in Southern Asia hear the name of Jesus and come to Him by faith through God’s grace. 


**We’ll have more big prayers tomorrow as we visit the Middle East. See you there!**
