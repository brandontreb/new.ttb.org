 We’re praying … God is answering!


January 08, 2020




If you are a regular listener of *Thru the Bible*, you know God is doing exciting things through our Home Groups in Asia. (If you don’t, learn about them at [TTB.org/HomeGroups](http://www.ttb.org/homegroups).)


The concept is simple: Gather 7-10 people every week to listen to *Thru the Bible* on a digital player, followed by discussion and prayer. Our hope is that the group eventually develops into a church fellowship and reaches out to others.


And it’s working! A partner in India who is helping launch the projects recently wrote:


*“We wanted to start small groups in our Malpahari (about 51,000 people speak Malpahari worldwide) congregation in order to teach the Word of God. But we did not know how to do it—we were helpless. We are very grateful for these messages that will help us strengthen our faith and grow deeper in God’s Word.”*


Praise God for His faithfulness. Join us as we ask Him to continue to open doors and hearts so that thousands more will hear His name in Southern Asia and Western Africa, where our Home Groups are established and growing.


Gregg Harris and Steve Shwetz will update us on our Home Groups during the January 28 broadcast of *Thru the Bible*. Listen on radio, by podcast, or [online at TTB.org](https://www.ttb.org/programs/the-5-year-study). 


**Come back tomorrow to pray for our ministry in Canada.**
