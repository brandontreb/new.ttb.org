 “I now feel like I can know God.”


January 17, 2020




God is at work through His Word! Consider this letter from a man who listens in his native language of Portuguese:


*“My name is Paulo. Although I have only listened to you for four days, it has been a blessing in my life. I have known* about *God my entire life, but now I feel like I can know* Him. *I am grateful for your ministry. I am studying the prophet Micah and I am curious to know how I can follow other studies when I finish this. Thank you. May the peace of God be with you."*


Isn’t that great? As we travel through the many countries of South America today, pray that *Thru the Bible’s* programs in more than seven languages reaches more people like Paulo. May each of them move from a knowledge *of* God into an intimate and saving relationship *with* His Son, Jesus Christ. As Jesus prayed in John 17:3, “And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.”


**On Monday we’ll travel some of the world’s most scenic terrain. Meet us in Southern Asia.**
