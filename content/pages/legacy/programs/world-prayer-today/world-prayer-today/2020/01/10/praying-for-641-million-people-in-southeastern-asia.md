 Praying for 641 million people in Southeastern Asia


January 10, 2020




Consisting of countries that are geographically south of China and Japan, east of India, west of Papua New Guinea, and north of Australia, the population of Southeastern Asia is more than 641 million people.


It’s for each of these people we intercede today as the World Prayer Team travels through Singapore, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, and more than seven other countries. Pray for listeners like this one in Vietnam who recently wrote: 


*“I am a young pastor. The church I lead is remote, in high mountains, and we have more than 100 members. I am so grateful for your teaching as it’s useful for both me and my congregation. Thanks to you, our knowledge about the Bible has improved.* 


*“The leaders in our church, including me, have had little formal education, so it is hard for us to guide members in understanding the Bible clearly. Your programs make terrific material for our Bible studies. Thank you for your faithful ministry.”*


Praise God for His faithful servants! Bow your head today and ask the Lord to multiply the ministry of this pastor and all those who are faithfully serving Him in Southeastern Asia. Ask God to multiply *Thru the Bible’s* reach to this region in more than 24 languages.


**Our exciting adventure in prayer continues on Monday! Meet us right back here.**
