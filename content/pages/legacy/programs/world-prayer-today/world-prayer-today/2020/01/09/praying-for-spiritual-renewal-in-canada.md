 Praying for spiritual renewal in Canada


January 09, 2020




Spiritual renewal. That’s what we’re praying for as the World Prayer Team travels on our knees to Canada. As one listener recently wrote:


*“I listen in French, and your Bible study is a breath of fresh air. The spiritual life of so many in our country is stale. God’s Word is the only thing that can renew and revive us. I pray you keep sharing these messages.”*


What a terrific letter. Let’s join this gentleman in asking God to sustain *Thru the Bible* in English, French, Low German, Spanish, and Arabic in Canada. Ask that His Word, faithfully taught, will bring about spiritual renewal and even revival—in Canada and in our own lives, families, communities, and countries.


**Our prayer journey continues—join us tomorrow as we end the week in Southeastern Asia.**
