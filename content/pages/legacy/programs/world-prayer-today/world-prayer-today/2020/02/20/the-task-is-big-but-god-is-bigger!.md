## 
 The task is big, but God is bigger!


February 20, 2020




Widely considered the poorest nation in Central Asia, more than 84 percent of those who call Tajikistan home live in poverty.


Welcome to World Prayer Today. Here’s a bit of background to help us as we pray:


* 94 percent of the population follows Islam
* 62 percent are unreached with the gospel
* Preaching and distributing religious materials is very difficult, if not illegal
* Many families are separated (more than one million men work outside the country)


It’s here among those fighting to survive (particularly the widows, orphans, and elderly) that we ask you to join us in praying for God’s Word to bring hope and eternal life to all those willing to believe in Jesus Christ as Savior.


While the task seems big, we know our God is bigger. So, pray with confidence today, knowing God is already opening the doors to accomplish this request.


**Our final stop in our journey through Central Asia is Turkmenistan. We’ll meet you there tomorrow.**
