 Praying for those hurting from the pains of childhood


February 25, 2020




*“I was angry with God, but your explanations of the Bible have been quite remarkable. Several years ago, I asked Him to heal me of trauma and disappointment of my childhood. I was unsure if this was possible, but as you promised, in Him I found more than the peace I was looking for. Here is my story:*


*“My parents used to fight a lot. One morning, when I was fifteen, I woke up and saw that there was no one in the house. My mother was a housewife and she was usually at home. My younger sister was still sleeping. I called for my mom, and I went down in the basement to look for her. That’s when I found both my parents dead. My father was a military person, so he had a gun. He killed my mother and then he killed himself.* 


*“That event left a deep wound on my heart. For a long time, I could not understand why God, if He even existed, allowed that to happen. But slowly and patiently He worked on my heart, and your teaching helped me understand the love of God and realize that Satan brings death and God brings life. He slowly changed me and attracted me to Himself.* 


*“The words of Dr. Mc Gee feed my heart like seed and brought life and fruit. Now I'm married, I have a good marriage and a happy family. I praise God for this miracle. Please pray for my sister and all those who are hurting from the pains of childhood. May they too test the depths of God’s love and learn to trust Him despite their hesitations.”*


What a terrific request. Today ask the Lord to draw those who are hurting to Himself—in Bosnia and around the world. May His Word be a healing balm for their wounded souls, and a refuge for their broken hearts.  


**We travel to Greece tomorrow for prayer and encouragement. See you there.**
