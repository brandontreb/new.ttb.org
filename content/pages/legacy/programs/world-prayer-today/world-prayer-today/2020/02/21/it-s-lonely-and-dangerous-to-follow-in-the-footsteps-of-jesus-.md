 “It’s lonely and dangerous to follow in the footsteps of Jesus.”


February 21, 2020




*“It’s lonely and dangerous to follow in the footsteps of Jesus.”*


That’s what we hear from one listener in Turkmenistan. Here’s the rest of his story:


*“My family has disowned me because of my new faith, and it is impossible to gather with other believers. When I listen to your teaching, I am given hope that one day I can share my love of Jesus with others. Until then I will listen and prepare myself.”*


Known for its paranoia, the government of Turkmenistan monitors all religious activities, including imposing tight restrictions on printing or importing Christian materials. But His Word can still be heard freely on the radio. Today, praise God for faithful listeners like this one who is walking with the Lord. Ask the Lord to strengthen their faith and encourage their hearts as they continue to secretly study His Word.


**We’ve got a lot to pray about in Southern Europe next week. Join us on your knees.**
