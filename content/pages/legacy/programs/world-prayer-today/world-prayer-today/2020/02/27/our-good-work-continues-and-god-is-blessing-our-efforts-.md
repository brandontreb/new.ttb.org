 “Our good work continues and God is blessing our efforts.”


February 27, 2020




Today’s stop on our world prayer tour brings us to Albania where we’re excited to meet a fellow team member who writes:


*“I have written to you before, but want you to know our good work continues and God is blessing our efforts. Please continue to pray for our church as we provide a warm meal for the poor children in the village. While cooking, we listen to your programs and pray for their stomachs to be filled by the food, and God’s Word to fill their hearts with the Bible story that is shared after the meal. I go also to another community nearby and share the Good News with the people there. We don’t have a place to gather, but we meet outside in a field to do our small meetings. Would you please pray for safe water and for a church building in the area of Sharre? I am grateful for your presence in my life and pray for your teaching as it is shared across the world.”*


It’s a privilege to come alongside this sister and pray for her ministry. As we lift her up today, pray also for those who share God’s love and His Word across Albania. May we all be a part of God’s great plan for this country and the world.


**We’ve got one more stop this week in our journey across Southern Europe, join us tomorrow in Kosovo.**
