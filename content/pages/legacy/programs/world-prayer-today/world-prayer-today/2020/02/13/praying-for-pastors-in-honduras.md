 Praying for pastors in Honduras


February 13, 2020




*Buenos dias!* Welcome to Honduras, where God’s Word is encouraging Spanish-speaking listeners like Daniel, who says:


*“For 12 years I have followed this program. Today I am a pastor—I went to school and I graduated, but I continue with the teaching of this ministry because it so deep. It has been a great blessing … let’s continue working for the glory and honor of our Lord Jesus Christ.”*


Today let’s pray for the pastors who work for the glory and honor of God in Honduras and around the world. May God strengthen them in their faith and protect their minds against the enemy as they continue to share His Word.


And as we pray for pastors today, let’s not forget to lift up the longtime host of *Thru the Bible’s* Spanish programs, Lemuel Larrosa, as well as Jehiel Ortiz, who this year will begin to take over the reins as Lemuel prepares for his retirement. This month marks the start of the 10th *A Través de la Biblia* Bible Bus journey!


**Our exciting journey continues tomorrow in Cuba. Be sure to join us.**
