 Praying with confidence in Nicaragua


February 10, 2020




*“Praise the Lord, you are still teaching the Bible!”*


That’s the warm greeting we receive from Mariana, a listener in Nicaragua. She continues:


*“I listened to you as a teenager, and one day the signal disappeared. Yesterday my son gave me a radio and it was tuned to your program. This was very special as my son is not a Christian, but he knew how much your program meant to me. It brings me such joy to listen to your explanations; it is as if no time has passed.* 


*“I thank God for you, and I thank you for the love with which you work for the Word of God. My husband and I greet you in Christ and wish the Lord to continue blessing you. Please pray for my son and his friends. It is hard for young people to submit themselves to the Lord’s sovereignty, but I know God is up to the challenge. One day, from their lips, His name will be praised.”*


**Today, let’s pray with the same confidence. W****herever God’s truth is heard in Nicaragua, may more people kneel before Him and praise His name.**
