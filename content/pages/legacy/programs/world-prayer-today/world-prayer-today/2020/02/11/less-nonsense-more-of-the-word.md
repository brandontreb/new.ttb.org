 Less nonsense, more of the Word


February 11, 2020




*“It’s never too late to learn about Jesus. I want to testify that in the last year and a half, much less nonsense has been sown in my heart and so much more Word!”*


That’s the terrific opening to a letter we received from an 80-year-old listener of our Dutch programs in Bonaire. She continues:


*“I have never been to church or educated in the Bible. Your lessons have helped me understand what is important in life. My only regret is that I didn’t find you sooner. I will waste no more time in getting to know the Lord and living this new life. I have invited my friends to listen with me and we have great discussions afterward. Please keep sharing these important teachings. I rely on them to get me through each day.”*


It’s true! It’s never too late to turn to Jesus. Pray today that more people hear God’s Word in Bonaire and throughout the Dutch Caribbean. May God’s Word draw them close and, regardless of their age, may they too begin a new life in Him.
