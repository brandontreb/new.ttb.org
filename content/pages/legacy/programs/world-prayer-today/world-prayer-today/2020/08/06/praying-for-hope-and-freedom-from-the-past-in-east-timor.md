 Praying for hope and freedom from the past in East Timor


August 06, 2020




After a violent struggle with Indonesia, in 2002 East Timor became an independent nation. However, lasting scars prevent peace and reconciliation with its people.

Welcome, World Prayer Team. We’re glad you’re here as together we pray for this young and struggling nation. As you pray, keep these things in mind:

* The Timorese people are caught in a vicious cycle of poverty, poor health, and illiteracy. The average worker makes $1.20 per day.
* East Timor has one of the highest rates of violence against women and girls in the Asian-Pacific region.
* The streets are flooded with children and young people who have nothing and are recruited for dangerous gangs.
* The majority of Timorese claim Christianity as their religion. However, most remain ignorant of the gospel.

As *Thru the Bible* goes out, pray Timorese (especially the young) will hear it and respond to the saving grace God offers through a relationship with His Son, Jesus Christ. As they learn to cast all their cares upon Him, may they find the strength to rise up and begin a new cycle of hope, joy, and freedom from the past.

**In times of fear and despair, what verse comes to your mind? A listener in the Philippines answers that question tomorrow. Come prepared with your answer, too.**
