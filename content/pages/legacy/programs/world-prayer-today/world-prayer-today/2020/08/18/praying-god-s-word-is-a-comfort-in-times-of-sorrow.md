 Praying God’s Word is a comfort in times of sorrow


August 18, 2020




***Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.*** **-Psalm 119:105**

Welcome to Karnataka, India, where a listener tells us how God’s Word has gotten her through some of her most difficult days. 

*“I have been listening to* Thru the Bible *for many years now. In this time, the Word of God has become a lamp to my feet and light to my path. As I sit and listen to the program, God gives me strength in my weakness and hope in my sorrow.* *My husband passed away a few months ago, and in my heartbreak I grew closer in my walk with God. He has directed my footsteps and His words have given me joy,* *peace, and happiness. It is my desire that others who live in sorrow will listen to His Word and find solace, too.”* 

Today pray for this listener and all who trust the Lord with their sorrow. May His comfort and encouragement be with them as they grieve, and may they ultimately find joy as they walk with Him each day.

**We’ve got good news from Jharkhand, India. See you there tomorrow.**
