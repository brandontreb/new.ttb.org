 Praying against rituals and tribal practices in Equatorial Guinea


August 10, 2020




Our worldwide prayer trek continues today in Equatorial Guinea.

This hot, humid nation is said to have the fastest growing economy in the world, and it ranks as the third largest oil exporter of the Sub-Sahara. However, this amassing of wealth combined with government corruption and mismanagement only intensifies the massive gap between the rich and the poor.

While we stop in the nation’s capital of Malabo and pray for wise leadership, we also ask God to root His Word in hearts and homes throughout Equatorial Guinea. While most claim Christianity as their religion, many still cling to rituals and tribal practices. 

One listener tells us:

*“I grew up in a family that blended faith in traditional religion and the occult world. Your messages on God’s Word have helped me understand we have been on the wrong path. Please pray with me that my family receives the truth, the light of God.”*

There we have it—intercede for this family and ask God to deliver all those involved with dark practices in Equatorial Guinea and throughout the world. May His truth set them free to live their lives for Him.

**Tomorrow we’re praying for the unreached in Chad. We’ll meet you there.**
