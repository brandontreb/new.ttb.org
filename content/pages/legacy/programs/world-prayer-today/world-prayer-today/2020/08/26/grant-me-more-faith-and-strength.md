 “Grant me more faith and strength …”


August 26, 2020




***My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.*** -2 Corinthians 12:9

More people live in China than any other nation, roughly 1.35 billion. And despite the tremendous growth of the church, more than 82% of people have yet to hear the Good News about Jesus Christ. 

That’s why *Thru the Bible* broadcasts in Mandarin and Cantonese every weekday on the internet and radio. Please pray more people will hear God’s Word and respond like this listener of our Cantonese programs:

*“I need to memorize the words of the Bible more and keep in mind that God is an almighty, all powerful, and wondrous God. I ask Him to grant me more faith and strength so I can be empowered by Him and overcome my weakness. I have always tried to do all things on my own. Now I know He has the ability to do all things through me.”*

God is working in China, answering our prayers. Continue to ask for God’s favor to reach the most remote and hardest of hearts in this nation filled with so many people He loves.

**A taxi driver in South Korea is sharing God’s Word with his passengers, one by one. Hear his story tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
