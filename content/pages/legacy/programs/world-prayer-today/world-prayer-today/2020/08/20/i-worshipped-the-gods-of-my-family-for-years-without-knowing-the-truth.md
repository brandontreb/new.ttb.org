 “I worshipped the gods of my family for years without knowing the truth.”


August 20, 2020




***For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.***-Hebrews 4:12

Since 1978, *Thru the Bible* in the language of Hindi has quietly and consistently pierced the hearts of listeners around the world. Today, let’s celebrate how God is answering our prayers through the spread of His Word in India. Here are a few recent texts:

One listener writes: *“After a serious accident, I am bedridden. The good that happened was that I began listening to your teaching and heard about Jesus Christ. Please pray for my healing.”*

Another said this: *“I retired from the military in 2016. I now have a lot of time to listen to the radio. I had a vague interest in your religion before, but now I am learning the Word of God and being able to grow spiritually. Please pray for God’s grace upon my family.”*

And a gentleman named Ratul shared this: *“I worshipped the gods of my family for years without knowing the truth. One day I heard your programs on Titus, and it changed my views. I now worship the Lord only and spend my time raising money to give others radios so they may hear of Jesus, too.”*

Praise God His Word is living and powerful in our lives and in all who hear it. Together let’s pray more people in India and throughout the world will come to know Him as they hear His truth and respond in faith.

**There’s more to pray about in India. Meet us tomorrow in Tamil Nadu.**
