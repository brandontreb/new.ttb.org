 “I could not leave my house to go outside, I was scared all the time.”


August 13, 2020




*“I have always lived in fear, but recent world events triggered panic in me. I could not leave my house to go outside, I was scared all the time.”*

That’s what we hear from a new listener in Cameroon as we pray our way through Middle Africa this week. She continues:

*“One day was particularly bad. I couldn’t stop crying and shaking. My son went to get my neighbor. As she entered our home, a sense of peacefulness came with her. She began praying for me and I began to relax. Later she came back with a radio and together we listened to your program. Since then, I have listened with her every day. Knowing God has a plan for this world, and for me and my family, has changed everything. I still fight fear, but I know He will help me be victorious. Please keep teaching. Some days God’s Word, explained by you, is the only thing that gets me through.”*

Praise God for His peace in the midst of our panic. As we pray today, let’s lift up all those dealing with anxiety and worry. May God’s perfect peace surround them and guard their hearts and minds through Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:7).

If you or someone you love is dealing with anxiety, download Dr. McGee’s free digital booklet, [“How to Have Peace in Anxious Times.”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_how-to-have-peace-in-anxious-times.pdf?sfvrsn=ff351e16_2) 

**Our prayer journey through Middle Africa ends tomorrow in Democratic Republic of Congo. Join us on your knees.**
