 Praying Daniel 9:19 for Japan


August 24, 2020




***O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and act! Do not delay for Your own sake, my God, for Your city and Your people are called by Your name.*** -Daniel 9:19

Spiritual breakthrough. That’s what we’re praying for today in Japan, where *Thru the Bible* is heard on a small number of FM radio stations. But this is no small job. Most Japanese have never heard about Jesus and have never met a Christian. 

Prayer team—as we make our way through Japan’s cities and small villages, pray for the majority of Japanese who do not consider themselves religious, but practice a mix of Buddhist, Shinto, Daoist, Confucian, Atheistic, and even Christian beliefs. 

Pray also for the few Christians here (less than 1% know Jesus as their Savior). Through them, may neighbors, friends, and family members see the light of Christ and develop an interest in a real and lasting relationship with the Creator of the universe, who wants to be the Shepherd of their hearts.

**Our worldwide prayer journey continues tomorrow in Hong Kong. Join us for an update from *Thru the Bible’s* president, Gregg Harris.**
