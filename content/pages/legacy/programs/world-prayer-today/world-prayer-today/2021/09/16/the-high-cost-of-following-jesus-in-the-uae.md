 The high cost of following Jesus in the UAE


September 16, 2021




***That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height—to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.*** -Ephesians 3:16-19

Imagine losing your children because you’ve chosen to follow Jesus. Or are forced to live in silence about your new faith because you fear being thrown out of our home. These are some of the horrific decisions God’s people face when leaving Islam in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

We’ve got a lot to pray about today as we travel on our knees. Here are a few more things to consider.  


* Sharing the gospel with family and friends is illegal in the UAE. Those who do can be arrested and deported.
* All Emirati Christians risk losing inheritance, their homes, and their spouses.
* Christians may be forced to marry Muslims, be fired, or placed under pressure to “work for free.”
* Emirati Christians can be prosecuted for apostasy, which is considered a crime.

Today as we intercede for these brothers and sisters, pray Ephesians 3:16-19 and thank God for His Spirit that’s with them, giving them His hope, strength, and His unending love every day. May they sense His presence as they risk everything to follow Him.
