 Pray for Haiti: A special prayer request from Gregg Harris


September 01, 2021





*“One thing we’ve
heard from people all around the world when they are suffering is that in
addition to tangible physical help, they also need spiritual
encouragement.”*  -Gregg Harris

Already
one of the world’s most impoverished nations, the 7.2 earthquake that hit Haiti
on August 14 has once again devastated the country. More than 2,000 are dead,
countless others are injured and missing, and even more are left without
shelter and water.

As
we continue to pray for God’s grace to be poured out through the many relief agencies
and workers serving as Jesus’ hands and feet on the ground, THRU the BIBLE’s
president Gregg Harris asks us to also pray specifically for God’s Word as it
goes out twice a day on THRU the BIBLE.

  
Despite
the aftershocks, the devastation, and the despair, we know God is at work
through His Word and in the hearts of His people. Today let’s thank Him for
being near to those who are hurting and ask Him to encourage them in ways only
He can.
