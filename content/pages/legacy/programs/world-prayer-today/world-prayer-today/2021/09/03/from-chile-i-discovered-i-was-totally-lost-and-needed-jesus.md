 From Chile: “I discovered I was totally lost and needed Jesus.”


September 03, 2021




***In all your ways acknowledge Him,******and He shall direct your paths.*** -Proverbs 3:6

 As we travel through God’s Word, what important lessons are you learning? It’s a question we ask frequently on the Bible Bus, and we never tire of the answers. Here’s a great one from Manuel in Chile:

*“I am a young man of 19 years. When I was 17, I stopped being an atheist, because one day, out of curiosity, I listened to your programs. I discovered I was totally lost and needed Jesus.*

*“More recently I’ve been listening to your programs on Daniel. What an eye opener. From Daniel I have learned to have the courage to put God first in my life and to not sacrifice His standards. I want to live my life for Him, but this is not always easy, so I would appreciate your prayers.”*

That’s a great request. Today let’s lift up all our brothers and sisters who seek to put Jesus first in their lives. May God direct their paths and use His Word to encourage them on the journey. 

 We’d love to hear your story, too. [Email](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#42002b202e27203731023636206c2d3025) us and tell us what God is doing in your life as we study His Word together.  

 **Rest up, prayer travelers. Next week we journey through Southern Asia. Meet us on Monday in Bangladesh.**
