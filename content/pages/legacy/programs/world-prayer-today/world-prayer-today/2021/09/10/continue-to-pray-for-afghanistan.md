 Continue to pray for Afghanistan


September 10, 2021




***I will love You, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies.*** -Psalm 18:1-3  

If you’ve already hopped aboard the Bible Bus [today](https://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/custom-player/), then you’ve heard Gregg and Steve talk about what THRU the BIBLE is doing to reach people with God’s Word in Afghanistan in this time of extreme national crisis. They shared these important requests—the same you received in the special email sent a couple weeks ago. Please keep praying for these four needs: 

* **Please pray for the effectiveness of THRU the BIBLE and our partner’s efforts** in getting Bible resources into the hands of Afghanistan’s Persian and Pashto-speaking populations. Pray with confidence and faith that the light of God’s Word will penetrate the darkness of this hour in Afghanistan.
* **Please pray for the underground Afghan church.** This young body of Christ has already experienced persecution, but now they must brace for harsher conditions and possible martyrdom.
* **Please pray for the displaced.** Many Christians are hiding in caves and mountains in the nearby desert, unwelcome in neighboring countries. Pray for supplies and survival resources to get to them before the onset of the harsh winter.
* **Pray fervently for the protection of women of all ages.** All Afghan women are at risk at the insidious hand of the Taliban. Pray for the lives of women and girls, for their freedom and safety, for their families, and for their futures.

And if you missed Gregg’s important video message sent out on August 21, here it is:

  
Keep praying, Team; God is at work in Afghanistan. When it feels like this injustice is larger than any of us can impact—remember you are praying to the God of all hope, who hears and answers prayer. Together let’s stand beside our Afghan brothers and sisters and intercede with confidence, knowing God is their rock and fortress in these desperate times. May God’s will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
