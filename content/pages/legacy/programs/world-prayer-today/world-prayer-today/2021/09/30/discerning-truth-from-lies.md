 Discerning truth from lies


September 30, 2021




*“I can now go anywhere without fearing being a victim of false teaching.”*

That’s the good news we hear from Jules, a new listener in Benin, Africa. He continues:

*“Since I was granted the grace of becoming a child of God, my greatest quest was truth. I quickly became discouraged as the preachers in my village teach many lies. I felt the Bible was difficult to understand on my own, and I was confused. Then I found your program. What I really like about* Thru the Bible *in Fongbe is the simplicity of the message, even as we learn difficult and sound doctrine. I am beginning to understand the Bible myself, and it reassures me that I am on the right path. I pray God will strengthen you in the name of Jesus.”*

Jules isn’t alone. It’s common for Beninese to mix Christianity with animist and voodoo practices, and there are very few trained pastors to share the truth. As we pray today, thank God for all those who want to know Him and desire to discern false teaching. Pray more will join them on the Bible Bus and ultimately become spiritual leaders in their communities and churches.

**Listeners in Cabo Verde are getting rid of rituals and getting to know Jesus. Join us tomorrow as we celebrate.**
