 Praying for hope and peace in Syria


September 14, 2021




“*As long as there are people like you to care and show the teaching of the Holy Bible, I believe there is hope for the world.”*

That’s the message we hear today from one THRU the BIBLE listener in war-torn Syria. She continues:

*“Your program is one of a kind. I have never heard the Bible explained the way you do. I never knew it could help us understand our lives and inform our decisions. Thank you for helping me grow in Christ and in changing my life from darkness to light!”*

Thank God that although many Christians have fled this Muslim-dominant nation, others are being drawn to Him daily through His Word. Pray more will hear the message of hope and peace that can be found in a relationship with Jesus. Through their witness, may His love be poured out on the millions of Syrians who are suffering today without knowing Him.

**God’s Word is breaking down barriers in Iraq. Pray with us for THRU the BIBLE in Kurdish tomorrow.**
