 Praying for the least, lost, and last in Liberia


September 27, 2021




Smiling faces and joyful laughter are what we’re met with when we touch down in Liberia. Yet as we travel through this vibrant and friendly country, we quickly realize life in Liberia is not easy.  

 After two brutal civil wars, the country was hit with another deadly event: the Ebola virus. While they are now officially Ebola free, the economy still struggles. To prepare our hearts as we pray for God’s Word and His precious people in Liberia, here are a few things to keep in mind:

 * Almost half of Liberia’s four million people are under the age of 15.
* Sex trafficking is widespread, and many of the victims are children.
* An estimated 54% of the population live in poverty.
* Only about 47% of adults and 54% of youth are literate.
* Throughout the civil wars and the Ebola virus, farmers fled their lands, leaving fields unplanted and without a harvest.
* Only a quarter of the population has access to safe drinking water.

The needs of Liberians are great, but our God is greater. Let’s pray together: 

 *Father, thank you that even in times of despair and brokenness, Your Spirit is with us. Please, put Your arms around Your children in Liberia so they feel Your comfort and hope; meet their needs both physically and spiritually. As your Word goes out today, remind each of them of Your love and that You came for the least, lost, and last in this world. In the precious name of Jesus, amen.*

***God’s Word is erasing spiritual doubt in Togo. Join us in prayer tomorrow.***
