 From Russia: “God got me through Covid-19.”


September 20, 2021




*“It felt like God abandoned me.”*  

 That’s the beginning of an email we received from Galina, a listener of THRU the BIBLE who struggles with complications from Covid-19. She continues: 

 *“I was struggling every day, both physically and mentally. Then I heard your program and God’s love for me changed everything. I now can see that God has been the one to get me through this whole situation. If it wasn’t for Him, I wouldn’t be alive right now. Thank you for helping me understand that the Lord is with me. He is helping me. I pray with His help my body will soon be completely healed.”*  

 Today pray for others in Russia (and around the world) struggling with the physical, mental, and emotional effects of Covid-19. Like Galina, may they too choose to put their fears aside and put their confidence in the power of God’s grace and love. 

 **Catch the Bible Bus today and hear more about THRU the BIBLE’s Russian ministry from Gregg and Steve. Then join us tomorrow as we travel on our knees to Bulgaria.**
