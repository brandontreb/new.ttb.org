 What would you do to hear God’s Word?


September 07, 2021




What would you do to hear God’s Word?

For most of us, access to God’s Word is available on demand by clicking an app or visiting TTB.org. But as we travel the world together on our knees, we realize for a lot of people it’s not that easy. Listen to this story from fellow Bible Bus passengers in West Bengal.

*“For the last two months, my wife and I have been listening to your Bengali program. Every morning we wake up at 3:00 AM and wait for this program on the radio. We live in a remote village. There is no one who can teach the Bible, only through you are we are able to learn chapter by chapter and also the background of each book. It does not matter what time of the day it airs, we will listen. So please keep teaching. Thank you for helping us know God and hear His Word. It has changed our lives.”*

Praise God for these faithful listeners and others throughout West Bengal. As they study with us, may He continue to draw them close and strengthen them in their faith.

**God’s Word is taking root in unlikely places. We’ll hear one of these great stories tomorrow in Pakistan.**
