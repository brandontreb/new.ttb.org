 From Iraq: “I am now close to God because of His grace and your teaching.”


September 15, 2021




In a country where more than 95% of people are Muslim and an astonishing 98% have never heard the gospel, God’s Word is quietly breaking down spiritual and cultural barriers as it changes lives.

Today our travels bring us to Erbil (the capital and most populated city in the Kurdistan region of Iraq) for a meeting with Sameerah. She tells us:  


*“I’m a student at the university. I began listening to a Christian radio station by accident. I really liked the songs and didn’t realize what they were about. Then, one evening, your program came on and captivated me. It caused me to find a Bible online and read it. I was shocked to find the truth about a book I heard lies about all my life. Thank you for the constant love you convey and your voice of truth to all people. I am now close to God because of His grace and your teaching.”*

God is answering our prayers! Ask Him to reach more students at the University of Erbil (and across Iraq) with His truth.

**We’re praying Ephesians 3:16-19 in the United Arab Emirates tomorrow. Meet us there.**
