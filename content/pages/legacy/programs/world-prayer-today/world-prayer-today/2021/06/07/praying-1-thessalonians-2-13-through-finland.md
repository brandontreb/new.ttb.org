 Praying 1 Thessalonians 2:13 through Finland


June 07, 2021




If you’re a hiker, kayaker, or skier, our journey through Finland will thrill and excite you. 

Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today as we thank God for His creativity expressed in the many sparkling lakes and towering forests that dot the countryside, we also pray that as His Word goes out in the Finnish language more people realize their need for a relationship with God. 

As we’ve discovered on other visits to this remarkable country, church attendance in Finland remains low (about 3% weekly) and Islam and other fringe religions are growing. 

So together let’s pray 1 Thessalonians 2:13 and praise God in faith for using His Word to reach the Finnish people.

*“Father we thank you without ceasing and pray that as Your Word goes out in Finland, many will ‘welcome it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the Word of God, which effectively works in those who believe.’ Bring all those who hear it to You in faith. Amen.”*

**Ever wanted to visit a snow motel? Tomorrow is your chance as our journey through northern Europe continues on World Prayer Today.**
