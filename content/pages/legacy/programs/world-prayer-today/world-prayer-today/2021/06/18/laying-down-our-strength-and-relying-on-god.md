 Laying down our strength and relying on God


June 18, 2021




***I will love You, O******Lord******, my strength. The******Lord******is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer;*** ***my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies.*** -Psalm 18:1-3

As our prayer journey throughout the United States and her territories comes to a close, we stop and praise God with a listener in Iowa. He shares:

*“You have been a lifeline to me during an extremely difficult time in my life. I once relied on my own strength to get me through each day. Now I am a regular passenger on the Bible Bus and put my trust only in God. In this short time, I have found Him more than trustworthy. From your studies, I have grown so much in my understanding of the Word and in my relationships with others. I really feel that I am being grounded upon the immovable rock, Jesus Christ. He is my hope in this world and the next.”*

Praise God for this new brother in Christ. Ask God to reach more in America with the Good News of His Son Jesus Christ. As you talk to Him today, tell Him about the many ways you feel safe in His care and thank Him for being the immovable rock in your life, too.

**On Monday we’re praying for churches in Austria to be filled. Meet us there.**
