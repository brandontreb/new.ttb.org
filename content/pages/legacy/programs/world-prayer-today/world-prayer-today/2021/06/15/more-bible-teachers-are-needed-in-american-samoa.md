 More Bible teachers are needed in American Samoa


June 15, 2021




***But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd. Then He said to His disciples,******“The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few.”*** *-*Matthew 9:36-37

Halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, five volcanic islands and two atolls make up the gorgeous territory of American Samoa.

Welcome to paradise! As we travel the pristine beaches and explore the healthy reefs teeming with colorful fish, we find that our prayers are needed for the clear and consistent teaching of God’s Word.

Together let’s ask God to meet this need and reach more in American Samoa with His Word.

*“Father, we are grateful for Your Word and for those who faithfully teach it. We pray more of Your children inside American Samoa are called to reach their people with the gospel and Your grace found so extravagantly in Scripture. For those who are serving, we ask for Your wisdom poured out in their lives so they serve you well, preparing a rich harvest for your kingdom. In the name of Jesus we pray, a**men**.”*

**A listener of THRU the BIBLE in Spanish shares God’s Word and it multiplies. Join us tomorrow as we celebrate.**
