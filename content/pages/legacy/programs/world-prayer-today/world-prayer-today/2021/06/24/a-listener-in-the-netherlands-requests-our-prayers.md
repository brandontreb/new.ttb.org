 A listener in the Netherlands requests our prayers


June 24, 2021




*“Now it is time to wake up the Netherlands and the world with the gospel.”*

That’s the urgent message we hear from Willem, a listener of THRU the BIBLE in Dutch. He continues:

*“Years ago, the people in our country started and ended the day on our knees. Today we are lost. People are fearful but do not turn to God. Thank you for your program that reminds us there is an anchor. There is hope in these dark times. Please pray more people seize the opportunities God has given us before it’s too late.”*

Less than 20% of Dutch people attend church regularly, and half of all church buildings have been destroyed or repurposed as taverns, mosques, etc. The nation is a world leader in promoting New Age worldviews, and more than 47% of the population does not claim a religion at all. Today join Willem and ask that as God’s Word heard on THRU the BIBLE reaches his countrymen, they seize His gracious offer of eternal life through His Son, our Savior, Jesus.

**God’s Word is changing lives in Germany. Come along as we praise Him tomorrow.**
