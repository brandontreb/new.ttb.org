 Trusting God with the shifting details of our lives


June 14, 2021




Welcome to Indiana. As we pray our way through small towns, roadside attractions (you can't miss the Monster Turtle of Fulk Lake), and natural wonders (the Upper Cataract Falls are to die for!), we stop and visit with Jan, a member of our World Prayer Team who recently received some life-changing news.

*“This year has been a difficult one. I am an only child but found out at age 71 I have an older sister. We have not met yet, but I am getting emails through Ancestry.com from her.*

*“My parents never told me they adopted me. I have so many questions, and I lift them up to God. He is keeping me balanced. I see His hands in my life. So precious is my Lord and Savior. May God bless you.”*

We never know what life will throw at us. Praise God He is our refuge and help through it all. Today pray for all those who unexpectedly face uncertainty. As circumstances change, may more people take His hand, trust in His steadfast character, and find strength in His unshakeable love.

**Grab a hat and some sunscreen, tomorrow we’re praying our way through American Samoa.**
