 God’s ministry in Spanish is multiplying


June 16, 2021




*“When God blesses you with His Word, you want to share it with everyone you know.”*

That’s the encouraging news we hear from David as our journey through the USA continues. Here’s the rest of his story.

*“I have been studying the Bible with you in Spanish for a few years and have meant to thank you for this incredible blessing. I have begun to share it with others and now have more than 30 people who join together over Zoom. Many are in the United States, but some are from other countries as well. I don’t know everyone who attends. Friends invite friends and we continue to grow. I pray for you to continue to be His instrument and thus be able to continue taking the gospel to all corners of the earth, as the great commission says.”*

What a great story of how God takes our offerings and multiplies them. Your prayers play an important part in this, too. Keep praying for God’s Word as it goes out in Spanish. Ask Him to use David and countless others to introduce their friends and family to His Word. Through them may the family of God increase by numbers that surpass our wildest dreams.
