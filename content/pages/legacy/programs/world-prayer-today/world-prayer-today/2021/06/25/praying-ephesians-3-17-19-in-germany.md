 Praying Ephesians 3:17-19 in Germany


June 25, 2021




Welcome, prayer warriors. We’ve traveled on our knees through Germany several times over the past few years, asking God to do a new thing in the hearts of those He loves. Today we stop and praise Him for His answers to our requests as we celebrate with a couple new passengers on the Bible Bus:

Baret tells us: *“I am twelve years old and have listened to your programs in both German and English. I think they are great. There are many things I did not know and will consider each passage more intensively.”*

Clara shares: *“My friend is suffering from multiple sclerosis. Your programs mean so much to her. When it is time to listen, she requests her elderly mother turn it on and her nursing staff join in listening. One nurse has downloaded the app on her phone so she can listen at home. It is my friend’s desire that God use her illness for His glory.”*

God is moving in the hearts of the German people. Let’s thank Him now by praying Ephesians 3:17-19.

*“Thank you, Lord, for hearing our prayers and using Your Word to move in the lives of Germans. We pray more will turn to your Son in faith. As we listen together, root and ground us in our faith so we may* *comprehend the width and length and depth and height of Your love, which is beyond our understanding. Please fill us with Your fullness today. Amen.”*

**Next week our travels take us to Southern Africa. Thank God for the privilege of praying together.**
