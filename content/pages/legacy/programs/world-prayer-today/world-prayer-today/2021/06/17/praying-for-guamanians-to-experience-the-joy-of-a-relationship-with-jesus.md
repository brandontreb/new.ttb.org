 Praying for Guamanians to experience the joy of a relationship with Jesus


June 17, 2021




Where does America’s day begin? 

Welcome, World Prayer travelers. Today our journey brings us to the US Territory of Guam. Located in the middle of the Pacific, just over the International Date Line, Guam is about three-quarters of the way from Hawaii to the Philippines … making it the first place in America to see the new day.

Known for more than just its gorgeous shorelines (and there are many), Guam boasts a unique history (there are more than 130 sites on the National Register of Historic Places) and heritage shared among multicultural and diverse islanders. 

While we tour, we take time to pray for God’s Word to flourish here. Micronesian groups have dozens of churches, although in more isolated villages tribal culture presents challenges to biblical values. The continued influence of cultural and animistic traditions holds back many people’s growth in godly faith. 

Today ask God for His Word to shine light on these dark rituals and for the truth to release Guamanians of this bondage. May old desires and practices be set aside when the joy and freedom of a relationship with Jesus is fully understood and experienced. 

**Tomorrow in our prayer trek we meet a new brother in Iowa. Together let’s celebrate.**
