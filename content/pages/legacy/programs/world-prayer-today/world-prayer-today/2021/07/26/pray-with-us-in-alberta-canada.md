 Pray with us in Alberta, Canada


July 26, 2021




A new week, a new adventure in prayer! Welcome, World Prayer Team, we’re glad to have your partnership in prayer. Our journey through Canada begins in Alberta, known for making its stunning and rugged terrain accessible to outdoor enthusiasts of all skill levels. 

 As we make our way through two of the world’s oldest national parks, Peyto Lake and the Columbia Icefield, we stop to take in the beauty and pray for God’s Word heard on THRU the BIBLE. 

 *Heavenly Father, thank You for the lakes, mountains, and all the earthly wonders You have created in Alberta. Your handiwork is on full display. Thank You that even more beautiful than the majesty of Your creation is Your Word and how it speaks to our hearts. As it goes out today, stir Your Spirit among those who are listening. May the good news of Your love shine brighter than the gorgeous surroundings … so that those who hear it cannot help but respond with wonder, faith, and trust. Amen.*

 **Next up on our Canadian tour: Prince Edward Island. Meet us there for some great sightseeing and some important prayer.**
