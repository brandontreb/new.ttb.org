 A listener in Tanzania reminds us that God is in control


July 07, 2021




***The Lord will perfect that which concerns me; Your mercy, O Lord, endures forever.*** -Psalm 138:8

*“We may not know what the future holds, but God does. He is in control.”*

That’s the encouraging greeting we receive from a listener today in Tanzania. He continues:

*“I pray you remember the truth of Psalm 138:8 and surrender everything to the Lord. He is faithful! He is trustworthy! He is actively involved in the details of our lives.”*

What a great reminder. As we pray for more Tanzanians to take hold of these promises, let’s share them with those in our lives, too. Like this brother, may God’s goodness in our lives be so exciting that it spills over into all we say and do. 

Know someone who is struggling and needs a reminder of God’s faithfulness in their lives? Send them a link or download a free copy of Dr. McGee’s booklet, [“What to Do When Life is Hard,”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_what-to-do-when-life-is-hard.pdf?sfvrsn=fe501e16_2) and share it with them today.

**Our journey through eastern Africa continues tomorrow in Madagascar. Join us on your knees.**
