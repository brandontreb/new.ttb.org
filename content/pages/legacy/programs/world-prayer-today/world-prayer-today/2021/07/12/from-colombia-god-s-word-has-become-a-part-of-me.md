 From Colombia: “God’s Word has become a part of me”


July 12, 2021




As our prayer journey through Central America and the Caribbean begins, we stop and visit with Manuel in Colombia who shares:

*“I have just finished going through Exodus with you, and everything is now clear and my life is changed. My heart is filled with gratitude for such an excellent program. I listen to you when I wake up, when I go to sleep, and when I am walking. God’s Word has become a part of me.”*

Isn’t that great? Today let’s pray all those who listen to THRU the BIBLE feel the same. From Colombia to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, throughout China, and wherever we live—may God’s Word "dwell in us richly” and God’s Spirit direct our lives each day.

Want to share how our studies together in God’s Word are making a difference in your life? [Email us](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#27656e656b626572746773736509485540) today.

**Tomorrow our journey brings us to Guatemala. We can’t wait to pray alongside you.**
