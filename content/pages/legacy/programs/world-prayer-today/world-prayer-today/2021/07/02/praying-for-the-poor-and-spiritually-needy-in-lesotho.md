 Praying for the poor and spiritually needy in Lesotho


July 02, 2021




***He raises the poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of the ash heap, that He may seat him with princes—with the princes of His people.*** -Psalm 113:7-8

Declaring its independence from the United Kingdom in 1966, Lesotho is one of only three independent states surrounded by the territory of another country (the other two are Vatican City and San Marino).  

 Today as we make our way through the chilly mountain terrain, we’re greeted by villagers on horseback in multi-colored balaclavas (essentially full-face masks) with blankets to share. As we travel a little further and meet with locals, we realize there are great needs and a lot to pray about. 

 Here are a few things to guide our prayers for those who live in Lesotho: 

 * 49% of people live below the poverty line, and unemployment is high (45%).
* The HIV/AIDS infection rate of nearly 24% is among the world’s highest.
* Wealth in the small nation is measured not in currency but in cattle. Many cultural rites are centered around the sacrifice of a cow, and villages are typically built around a cattle pen.
* While Christianity is named the largest religion in Lesotho, it’s often mixed with rituals. People are commonly pressured by family members and friends against accepting the gospel.
* Pastors are in need of solid, Bible-based training and great discernment to root out traditional beliefs from those seeking to follow Jesus.

As you pray today, remember God’s promises in Psalm 113:7-8. Pray with confidence, knowing God loves the poor and spiritually needy in Lesotho and works on their behalf. Thank Him for hearing their cries and drawing them to Himself. 

 **We’ve got good news to share in Kenya. Meet us there on Monday.**
