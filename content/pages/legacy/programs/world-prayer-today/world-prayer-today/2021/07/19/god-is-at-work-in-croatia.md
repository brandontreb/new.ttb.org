 God is at work in Croatia


July 19, 2021




As we travel the world together on our knees, it’s inspiring to hear which part of His Word God uses to reach each one of us. Today as we touch down in Croatia’s capital of Zagreb, we meet with a listener who tell us it was Lot’s story that grabbed His attention.

*“My parents are longtime listeners of your program. Throughout Covid, I moved in with them so we could be together during lockdown. In the evenings, we all spent time with you. Your explanations were so detailed, I was surprised how there is so much more to the Bible than I originally thought. When we got to the story of Lot in Genesis, I was changed. His failures and the way God dealt with him spoke to me. Thank you for helping me realize how much I need God and how much the Bible can teach me.”*

It’s true. God’s Word is “living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword” (Hebrews 4:12). Thank Him today for how He is working in the lives of this listener in Croatia and how He works in our lives today. As THRU the BIBLE goes out today in more than 130 languages worldwide, pray more people join us and experience the transforming gift of salvation God has for them.

**God’s Word is transforming lives in Montenegro. Pray with us tomorrow as the journey continues.**
