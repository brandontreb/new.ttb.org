 A listener in Mexico discovers the secret of Christian living


July 16, 2021




***“Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,” says the Lord of hosts.***-Zechariah 4:6

Our journey through Central America and the Caribbean ends today in Mexico as we visit with Patricia who tells us why this verse is important to her.

*“I’m grateful for your studies that help me live according to God’s will. For many years I attended church and still felt empty. I tried to live a good life and be a good person, but I just fell short. In a serious talk with a neighbor not long ago, she mentioned your programs. As I started listening, I realized that I believed in God, but I didn’t know Him. That’s when God saved me. Jesus became my Lord and Savior, and now like it says in Zechariah 4:6, I can live my life for Him because His Spirit helps me. What a revelation!”*

Today thank God for His grace that saves us and His Spirit that teaches and guides us. As you do, pray more people in Mexico hop aboard the Bible Bus with us and travel through His whole Word as we learn these important truths.
