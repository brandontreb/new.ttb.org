 From Quebec: “I feel closer to God now more than ever”


July 28, 2021




*“You’ve opened my eyes to the world.”* 

 That’s what we hear from a fellow World Prayer Team member named Brenda as our journey through Canada continues. Here’s more of her story. 

 *“I started praying with you a few months ago, and it’s gotten the focus from me and onto others. I’ve loved learning about the languages and people who are listening to God’s Word. Thank you for helping me pray regularly for things that matter to God and not just to me. I feel closer to God now more than ever.”* 

 We pray that’s your experience, too. As you pray for all those whom God loves in Quebec, may you be reminded of His love for you and His plan to draw You to Himself every day. Together as we study His Word, may we all “grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:18). 

 **Have you ever traveled to Prince Albert National Park? Join us tomorrow as we journey on our knees.**
