 Praying Psalm 119:18 through Prince Edward Island


July 27, 2021




***Open my eyes, that I may see******wondrous things from Your law.*** -Psalm 119:18 

 Lighthouse spotting. Have you heard of this popular pastime? Today in our travels, we discover there is nowhere better to take in the scenic fun and fascinating history of this activity than Prince Edward Island, which boasts more than 63 lighthouses of various shapes, sizes, and designs. 

 After the fun, we continue our intercession for Canada as we pray Psalm 119:18 over this maritime province. Let’s pray together now: 

 *Heavenly Father, open the eyes of all those who hop aboard the Bible Bus with us today. As we study together, help us to see the wonders found in Your Word. We pray especially for those who don’t yet know You. May they believe Your truth about their sinful hearts and also believe Your promise to forgive and restore. We also ask for Your grace in the lives of our brothers and sisters living in Prince Edward Island. Help them to be faithful, obedient, and seek Your honor and glory in all they do. In the name of Jesus we pray, amen.*                                                         

 **We’ve got more to pray about tomorrow. Meet you then in Quebec.**
