## 
 A listener in El Salvador turns back to God


July 14, 2021




Our travels today take us off the beaten path to a small country filled with adventure. Join as we wander the dark sand beaches, tour coffee plantations, and enjoy the flower-filled villages of El Salvador.  

 While we take in the beauty and pray for God’s work here, we also stop and meet with Cristina who shares her story: 

*“Jesus was once my true love, but as I got older, He was replaced by more worldly desires. Recently I heard your program and knew what I had been missing. I have joined you each day since, and God is clearing the cobwebs from His home in my heart and transforming me with His love.”*   


Praise God His Word is heard by Cristina and millions of other Spanish speakers in Central America. Keep praying more will join us on the Bible Bus and that they, too, will be transformed by the power of His Word. Here’s a reminder of what God promises through His Word: 

 ***The law of the*** ***Lord******is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the*** ***Lord******is sure, making wise the simple; the statutes of the*** ***Lord******are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the*** ***Lord******is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of the*** ***Lord******is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the*** ***Lord******are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.***-Psalm 19:7-10 

**Christians in Haiti need our prayers. Meet us there tomorrow.**
