 “A peace like I’ve never known”


May 28, 2021




Welcome to Latvia. As we touch down in the capital city of Riga, we immediately notice the intriguing art nouveau buildings. Latvia is an undiscovered gem for travelers. As we walk a little further, we meet with Ivars, who shares why God’s Word heard on THRU the BIBLE is important to him.

*“I am so glad to find you on the radio. I listen every day and am filled with a sense a peace I have not known. I have always considered myself a Christian, but I did not study the Word of God. There is much hopelessness here that I think could be overcome if many more would hear your teaching. As soon as the announcer comes on the radio, I feel like a relative is visiting my home with good news and a cheerful heart. Thank you for your presence in my life.”*

Like Ivars, 60% of Latvians identify themselves as Christians, but only a small minority actually practice their faith. Keep praying more Latvians will hear God’s Word and choose to follow Him. 

**On Monday we’ll begin a week-long journey through Western Africa. Meet us in Ghana.**
