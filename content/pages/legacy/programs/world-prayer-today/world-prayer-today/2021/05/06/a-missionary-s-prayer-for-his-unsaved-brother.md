 A missionary’s prayer for his unsaved brother


May 06, 2021




The most frequent request we receive is to pray for unsaved family members. Dimas from Colombia asks us to add his brother to the list:

*“I am an indigenous missionary and join you on the Bible Bus each day. I pray for all the listener requests, and now I’m asking the prayer team to intercede for my brother.* 

*“I live in Colombia but my older brother, Oscar, is in Florida and recently lost his wife to Covid-19. Please pray for his salvation.*

*“I tell everyone I know about your programs and pray they come to realize the power of God. My deepest desire is that my brother is among them. May God bless each of you as you study His Word.”*

Has God answered your prayers for the salvation of a family member? Share your encouraging story by emailing us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f5b7bcb7b9b0b7a0a6b5a1a1b7db9a8792). And if you’re praying for an unsaved family member and would like some resources to share with them, click [here](https://www.ttb.org/salvation) to find several of Dr. McGee’s free digital booklets and sermons.

**Be sure to pray for Dimas and his family today as you pray for your own. See you tomorrow in Ghana.**
