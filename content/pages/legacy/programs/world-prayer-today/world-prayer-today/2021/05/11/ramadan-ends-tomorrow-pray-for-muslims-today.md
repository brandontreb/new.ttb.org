 Ramadan ends tomorrow; pray for Muslims today


May 11, 2021




During the month of Ramadan (ending this year on May 12), Muslims around the world have been fasting and praying, hoping to come closer to Allah. So, today our team stops and prays in Pakistan, where more than 95% of the people are Muslim.

As their celebration of Eid Al-Fitr begins tomorrow and signifies the end of Ramadan, let’s boldly pray that entire families and communities begin to question Islam and look for answers in God’s Word. May the futility of striving to earn Allah’s favor become apparent and instead the desire for a relationship with God become overwhelmingly attractive. 

It’s a huge request, but we know God is already at work accomplishing His purposes in the lives of His people. Through dreams, visions, and of course the understanding of His Word, more Muslims have turned to Jesus in the last 15 years than in the previous 400 years combined. So today let’s praise Him and pray more will follow.

**Join us tomorrow in Tripura, India.**
