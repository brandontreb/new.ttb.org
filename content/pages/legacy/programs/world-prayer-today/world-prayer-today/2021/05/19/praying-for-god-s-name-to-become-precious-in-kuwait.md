 Praying for God’s name to become precious in Kuwait


May 19, 2021




Quick—what’s the first word that comes to mind when you hear “Kuwait”? 

Is it oil?Oil is the primary economic driver behind the Kuwaiti economy, and Kuwait possesses roughly 7% of the world’s proven oil reserve and produces over 2.6 million barrels every day.

If you didn’t say oil, did you say Islam? Sunni Islam is the official religion of Kuwait, and 60% of Kuwaitis follow that faith. 25% are Shi’a Muslims.

But would you be surprised to know that more that more 14% are Christian? Between 2005 and 2010, Christianity in Kuwait had an annual growth rate of nearly 6%, however more than half the population still have yet to hear the name of Jesus. 

Today as we travel on our knees through this desert country, pray God’s Word multiplies in the lives and hearts of all those who hear it. May God’s name become more precious in Kuwait than anything they’ve ever heard … particularly that which they hold most dear: oil and Islam.

**Despite the risks, a couple chooses Jesus in Iran. Pray for them and other background believers tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
