 Unraveling the depths of God’s love in Israel


May 21, 2021




***“For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.”*** -John 3:17

As we pray our way through Israel, we praise God for the truth of John 3:17 in the life of Ali, a listener who joins us on the Bible Bus in Arabic. He tells us:

“*I have become a Christian through your programs. It is very different than what I was taught. Learning about Jesus and the fact that instead of condemning us, He took the penalty of our sins, is much to take in. The depth of God’s love is perplexing, but I am so grateful.”*

*God’s great love is perplexing, isn’t it? In the best of ways. Thank God for His grace in the life of Ali and in yours, too. Keep praying for the Bible Bus as it makes its way throughout Israel and the entire world.* 

***Have you traveled to Belarus? Join us on Monday as we travel on our knees to what many call “Europe’s last dictatorship.”***
