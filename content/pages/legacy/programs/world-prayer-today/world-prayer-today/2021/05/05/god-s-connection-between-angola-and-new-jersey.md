 God’s connection between Angola and New Jersey


May 05, 2021




*“My life and walk with the Lord would not have been the same without this program.”*

That’s what we hear from a listener named Leila in New Jersey today. She continues:

*“I was lifted up and encouraged by a recent World Prayer Team email and information from Steve and Gregg on Angola****.*** *Hearing the clips of* Thru the Bible *in other languages around the world brings tears to my eyes. It gives me great joy and hope to hear about my brothers and sisters around the world and know that we are connected in studying God’s Word.”*

What does the World Prayer Team mean to you? Like Leila, have you been encouraged by the testimonies of our fellow listeners around the world? Is there a specific story that’s captured your attention? Or is there a location the Lord has impressed on your heart? We’d love to hear from you and share your encouragement with others. Email and tell us today at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#baf8f3f8f6fff8efe9faeeeef894d5c8dd).
