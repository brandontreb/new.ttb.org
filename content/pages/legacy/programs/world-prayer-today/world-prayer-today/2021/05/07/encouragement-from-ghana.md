 Encouragement from Ghana


May 07, 2021




We end a week of great travels visiting with a friend in Ghana who shares how much our intercession and letters mean to him. 

 *“I feel your prayers each time I hear God’s Word. I know there are many who lift up our nation across the world. The testimonies from other listeners are very encouraging. I want you to know that I pray you never stop reading God’s Word. The Bible nourishes our souls and spirits, and as we come together I know God blesses us.”*

 What a great prayer. Today join him in asking God to help us persevere in the study of His Word. Ask Him to remove all barriers keeping us from Him and to give each of us a deep desire to sit humbly and regularly at His feet. 

 Are you praying for your brothers and sisters on the World Prayer Team? Do you have an encouraging testimony to share with them? Write to us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fbb9b2b9b7beb9aea8bbafafb9d594899c).

**On Monday we begin our journey in a city many travelers describe as “beautiful chaos.”**
