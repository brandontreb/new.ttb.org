 “God’s Word has become a song in my heart”


May 26, 2021




***“I will bless the Lord at all times;******His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make its boast in the Lord; the humble shall hear of it and be glad. Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.”*** -Psalm 34:1-3  

Our prayer journey through Eastern Europe continues today with a stop in Hungary where we immediately notice the architectural diversity in cities like Budapest, Szeged, and Sopron. 

As we walk the streets, we take in architectural gems of all types including Roman ruins and medieval townhouses, baroque churches, neoclassical public buildings, and art nouveau bathhouses and schools. But as we talk with fellow THRU the BIBLE listeners, we quickly realize the true treasure in Hungary is found within the hearts of God’s people. Listen to Greta’s story: 

*“God’s Word has become a song in my heart. I praise Him when I wake in the morning and all throughout the day. When my head is upon my pillow I continue to think about His goodness and all He has done for me. Your teaching is among the things I thank Him for. I can longer go to church because I am weak, but the opportunity to have His Word taught in my home is an overwhelming blessing. I am never alone because He is with me. In my many years, I have always found God meets our needs and exceeds our expectations. I pray everyone who hears His Word on* Thru the Bible *will speak, sing, and shout praises to Him and glorify His name forever.”*How are you praising the Lord today? If you need a start, begin by reading Psalm 34 aloud. And while you’re in His presence, thank Him for the many ways He’s using THRU the BIBLE’s Hungarian programs to encourage listeners like Greta. Though they are isolated, we are grateful they are never alone. 

**A night guard and nursing home patient meet over God’s Word each night. Find out more tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
