 God’s Word is a breath of fresh air amid restrictions in Belarus


May 24, 2021




Our travels today bring us back to the country of Belarus where God is answering our prayers. If you recall from previous visits, Belarus is often called “Europe’s last dictatorship.” Speech, press, and religion are all under tight government control. 

Yet, surprisingly, God’s Word is taking root and His church is growing. A listener named Natalia tells us what THRU the BIBLE is in her home.

*“I have been listening to you for several years, and I try to never miss your programs. Whatever subject you are discussing, you always talk about Christ and faith in God. This is so important to me! You help strengthen my faith, and I know that many others are being introduced to Jesus through you. Your programs are a breath of fresh air for all of us.”*

God’s Word is always a breath of fresh air. Can you imagine how much more so in a place with such heavy restrictions? Pray today for Natalia and all those who worship God in Belarus. Ask God to bring many more to faith in Him, especially President Alexander Lukashenko and government officials close to him. May Belarus become a nation that seeks the Lord and follows His ways.

***Tomorrow we continue our journey through Eastern Europe praying for Romania. Invite a friend to join you.***
