 Pray for renewed spirits in New Zealand


April 09, 2021




*“While my body withers, God renews my spirit each day.”*

That’s the inspiring word we receive from a fellow Bible Bus traveler from New Zealand as our prayer journey through Oceania continues. Here’s the rest of his story:

*“After an accident, I am bedridden. I found your teaching in Hindi and listen several times a day. Now while God’s Word renews my mind, I pray He will heal my body. I realize He may not, but I praise Him anyway. The more I listen, the more I have started to understand that I may have more purpose here in bed than if I was walking about. I have no distractions from praising Him, my focus is razor sharp. Please pray for God’s will in my life.”*

Amazing story, isn’t it? Today as you pray for this gentleman, pray more people in New Zealand hear His Word on THRU the BIBLE and have their spirits renewed each day as well. 

**Eastern Asia is our destination next week. Hop aboard as we head to China on Monday.**
