 The privilege of praying together


April 06, 2021




It may surprise you, but Australia is considered one of the most culturally diverse nations in the world. With 28% of the population born overseas and from non-western backgrounds, THRU the BIBLE is committed to reaching listeners like this one who has recently joined us on the Bible Bus in his language of Arabic.

*“May I have any literature that could help me understand more your religion? I have recently begun listening to your programs, and I am surprised by the depth of your message. It is different than I have been taught, and it is wonderful. I am surprised at the message of goodness found in Jesus. There is no anger, there is no hate for others … His only message is love. I want to know more about this way of life.”*

God is changing hearts through His Word. What a privilege it is to be part of His team. 

Today ask Him to reach more people in Australia and Oceania with the good news of the gospel and the depth of discipleship for His followers. May God’s Word heard on THRU the BIBLE in languages like Arabic and Hindi lead others into a sweet and eternal relationship with Him through His Son, Jesus.

**Tomorrow we travel to one of the most beautiful places on earth. Join us on the island of Fiji as we praise God for the beauty of His creation and the beautiful hearts of His people.**
