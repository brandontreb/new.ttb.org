 Thanking God for the promise of 1 Corinthians 3:11


April 01, 2021




***For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.***-1 Corinthians 3:11   


Our journey celebrating God’s goodness in our lives continues as we stop in New York and visit with a Bible Bus passenger named Jorge. He says:

 *“For many this year has been full of unknowns. In these moments of such uncertainty, you have been of great blessing to me. I listen each day and through you I have developed a relationship with Jesus. He alone is now where I place my hope and trust for the future. Though I haven’t listened long, you are already part of me.”*  

 Thank the Lord for His firm foundation when the world feels like it’s spinning out of control; we can build our lives on Him. He alone is our security, and in Him we can always find refuge. As you praise Him today, ask that more New Yorkers like Jorge (and others across the globe) will realize the power and peace found in humbling themselves before Him.  


**There is no place we’d rather be tomorrow than celebrating God’s goodness alongside you. Join as we travel together (on our knees) through Benin.**
