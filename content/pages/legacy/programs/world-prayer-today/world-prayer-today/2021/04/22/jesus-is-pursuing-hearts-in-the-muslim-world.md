 Jesus is pursuing hearts in the Muslim world


April 22, 2021




*“I am a Muslim, but for some time Jesus has come to me in dreams.”*

That’s what we hear today from one listener of THRU the BIBLE as we travel through Morocco today. Here’s the rest of his story.

*“Because of these dreams, I want to know Him more. I found your program and have been listening. Can I have a Bible? I don’t know where to get one. I don’t know if I’m allowed to have one, but I’m curious.”*

Thank God He is pursuing hearts in the Muslim world. Thank Him for the opportunity to partner with Him through prayer. Boldly intercede for His Word to be heard and His name to be praised in every home across Morocco. 

**We’re praying for brave sisters tomorrow in Libya. Invite a friend to join us at** [**TTB.org/pray**](https://www.ttb.org/pray)**.**
