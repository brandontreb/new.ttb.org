 A listener in Algeria learns the “secret” to living for God


April 19, 2021




*“If there is a record in heaven of those who have failed the most, I believe my name is at the top.”*

Welcome to northern Africa. Our journey this week begins in Algeria where we meet with a listener named Timothy. He continues:

*“I cannot count the number of times I have committed my life to God and fallen on my face. I was discouraged. Then I heard your programs. Your beautiful words and exhortations spoke to me, but what really helped was your teaching on the Holy Spirit. I get it now, I can’t do it on my own, only through the Spirit of God can I live a life that pleases Him. I now lay myself at His feet and look forward to growing in my faith.”*

Thank God for the work of His Spirit in Timothy’s life and in our own. And as we’re on our knees, let’s ask Him to use His Word taught on THRU the BIBLE to reach the millions of Algerians who have yet to hear the name of Jesus.

**Our journey in prayer continues tomorrow as we meet with two sisters in Western Sahara.**
