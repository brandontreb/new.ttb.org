 Praying John 14:27 in Fiji


April 07, 2021




***“Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”***-John 14:27

Throughout history, Indo-Fijians have lived difficult lives. Before gaining independence, indentured servants from India were brought to work in the sugarcane fields, leading to a history of racism and segregation between natives and Indian Fijians that continues today. As we’ve mentioned before, Indo-Fijians make up more than 35% of the population (with the majority practicing Hinduism) and are denied land rights although they are leaders in commercial activity. 

Welcome, World Prayer Team. It’s here in the middle of continuing racism and segregation that THRU the BIBLE is heard in Hindi. Pray with us that God’s Word will reach into more homes like this one:

*“My husband and I listen to your radio program in the morning and we both are blessed through it. We receive a new hope through listening and learning about Scripture. We try to share the joy and the peace we find with others. There are many in our community who urgently need it. Please pray for my husband, his right side of the body is paralyzed. We do not let this deter us. We rest in God’s peace and do not let fear take hold in our lives. Our trust is completely in the Lord.”*

Today read John 14:27 a few times and thank God for the faith and ministry of this couple. Is your trust fully placed in the Lord? For a little encouragement to let go of your worries and let God reign in your life, download Dr. McGee’s free booklet, [“How to Have Peace in Anxious Times.”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_how-to-have-peace-in-anxious-times.pdf?sfvrsn=ff351e16_2)

**Don’t miss tomorrow’s prayer stop—we’ll be with a fellow listener in Papua New Guinea hearing why they love the Bible. See you there.**
