 We’re “groaning” today for Christians in North Korea


April 16, 2021




***Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.***-Romans 8:26

North Korea is at war with Christians. Their aggressive pursuit of God’s people is unlike any other nation on earth. As we pray today, keep these things in mind.  


* According to Voice of the Martyrs and Open Doors watchlists, multiple thousands of Christians are currently imprisoned for their faith.
* Most North Koreans who choose to believe in Jesus do so in secret. Houses are under surveillance and children are encouraged by teachers to report any sign of faith in the home.
* Secret agents in China are tasked with finding and abducting North Korean Christians who have fled the country.

Adequately expressing our heartbreak about these needs before God may seem impossible. So, as we come before the throne of grace, thank Him for His promise in Romans 8:26. Ask His Spirit to take our prayers and broken hearts for our brothers and sisters and translate them for us. Let’s together entrust the lives of North Korean Christians to God’s protection and ask for God’s grace to reach those who have never heard or understood God’s Word. 

**On Monday, we’ll begin studying the book of Genesis with Dr. McGee. Join us on the Bible Bus and join us here on World Prayer Today as we travel on our knees to Algeria.**
