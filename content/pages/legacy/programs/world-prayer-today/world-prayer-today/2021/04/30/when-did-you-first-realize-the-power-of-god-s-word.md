 When did you first realize the power of God’s Word?


April 30, 2021




Do you remember the excitement you felt when you first realized the power of God’s Word? Listen as Mateo in Uruguay shares his story:

*“These studies in John have changed my life forever. I cannot stop talking about what I’ve learned. At first, a couple of men at my work were irritated by my constant updates. However, as I continue to describe your beautiful and rewarding explanations, they have now started to board the Bible Bus, too. I know this is only the beginning of what I have to learn, but I praise God for the things He has taught me already. I am only sorry I didn’t begin to study the amazing truth He has given us earlier.”*

As we thank God for the opportunity to share His Word in Uruguay, ask Him to prepare more hearts like Mateo’s to receive it. Pray that their initial excitement turns into a deep, abiding, and lifelong love for spending time with Him. Pray that for each of us as well. 

**We’ve got a lot to pray about next week in southern Asia. Rest up and join us for the journey in Uttar Pradesh, India, on Monday.**
