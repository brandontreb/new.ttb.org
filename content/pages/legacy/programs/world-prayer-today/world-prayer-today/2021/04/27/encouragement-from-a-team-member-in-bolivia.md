 Encouragement from a team member in Bolivia


April 27, 2021




***Let your light so shine before men,******that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.***-Matthew 5:16

Our adventures in prayer continue as today we stop in Bolivia and visit with a fellow World Prayer Team member named Maria. She says:

*“Each day as God’s Word goes out on* Thru the Bible*, I am in constant prayer for more people to be reached, for more languages to be added, and for God to be glorified in more places on earth. His name is great, and it is a privilege to ask Him to reach every home and heart in this world.* 

*“God has called us to shine our light before men. I continually work to reflect His grace to those around me, but to be part of shining that light worldwide with you is more precious than I can imagine. In heaven we will all rejoice and say thank you to our sovereign God for the privilege of being His child. Keep going, World Prayer Team, we do not know when our time here is done, but let’s keep our lights bright and hopefully more people will join us day by day.”*

What great encouragement. Today as we pray for God’s Word to reach more Bolivians, also pray for your fellow team members. Pray their faith is renewed as they spend time with us in the Bible. May each of us receive joy as we share God’s heart for His people through prayer. 

**Hatred between sisters almost destroyed a family, but God’s Word is bringing them back together. Join us tomorrow in Argentina for this amazing story.**
