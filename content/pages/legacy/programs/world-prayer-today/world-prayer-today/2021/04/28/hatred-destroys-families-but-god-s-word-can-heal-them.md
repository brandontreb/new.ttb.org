 Hatred destroys families, but God’s Word can heal them


April 28, 2021




*“The hate I held in my heart toward my sister almost destroyed my family and nearly brought an end to my life. And then God intervened.”*

That’s the beginning of the great story we hear from Gina from Argentina. Here’s the rest:

*“As long as I can remember, my older sister would make up things to get me in trouble with our parents and embarrass me in front of my friends. She would call me names at school and tell lies about me to teachers. Though she never hurt me badly, she would hit me in places where my parents wouldn’t see bumps and bruises.* 

*“Each day my anger for her grew. Over years we stopped talking to each other unless we were screaming. Our parents gave up their room so we did not have to share any longer. Living under the same roof became so unbearable that I thought about killing myself. One day as I was researching ways to die, I came across a woman who was suggesting people listen to your program first. I am not sure why, but I was drawn to her words and followed the link. Each day after, I listened as well. I quickly felt a peace I had never known, and soon my parents noticed a change in my behavior and started listening with me. Together we found Jesus. I asked their forgiveness for my part in our turmoil, and we prayed for God to heal our family.* 

*“My sister hasn’t changed much, but through God’s grace and the help of my parents, I have stopped reacting. The level of anxiety in our home has greatly decreased, and the joy of praying with my parents and going to church together has helped me grow a great deal. Please pray my sister is delivered from her anger and unhappiness. Our greatest desire is that she too gives her life to Christ. We want her to experience the peace and joy He has given the three of us.”*

We’ve said it many times before, but there really is no pain like family pain. As we pray for Gina’s family, pray for all struggling families in Argentina. As they study God’s Word and grow closer to him, may His love be the foundation on which healthy relationships are built and hearts are restored.

**Our journey continues tomorrow in Brazil. Come pray with us.**
