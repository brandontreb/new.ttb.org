 Praying for marriages


December 28, 2021




*“Your teaching in the book of John saved our marriage,”* says a listener of THRU the BIBLE who joins us in his native language of Zulu.   


He continues: 

*“We have been married for three years. Last year, 2020, was a tough year for our family. It started with job loss for both me and my wife, and slowly but surely we lost our joy in one another. Over time our marriage became very sour. One day early in the morning thinking about what I had to do, I heard these words on the radio: ‘Maybe you have lost hope, we invite you to listen to the Word of life.’ Then your teaching came on. After that day I started listening and actively inviting Jesus into our home. I pray for God to work with our situation and intervene. Since then, many things have resolved. I believe God was waiting for us to make Him center of our lives and to believe His Word. You are now our family friends. We listen and always learn something new! God bless you all.”*

Praise God for the healing power of His Word. Let’s pray together for the marriages of all those on the Bible Bus with us.

*Father, grant us the strength to hold fast to our vows. Help us to love, honor, and cherish each other as long as we both shall live. Make us more like You each day so we can reflect Your patience, kindness, forgiveness, and grace to each other.* *Help us to be good listeners who are sensitive to each other’s needs. May our differences sharpen each other to grow stronger in faith and challenge each other to consider new things. Guide us so we can honor You and one another with all we say and do. In the precious name of Jesus, amen.*

**We’re off to New Jersey tomorrow. Praise and pray with us and invite a friend, too.**
