 Pray for a secret believer in Nigeria


December 10, 2021




*“Every other religion says ‘do.’ Christianity says ‘done.’ The transaction for your soul is done. God asks you to believe it.”* -Dr. J. Vernon McGee from our study in Galatians

*“I was a Muslim but have found your programs and now want to be a Christian. Please tell me what to do. My parents will be shamed for my new faith, so they must not know. Please respond discreetly.”*

That’s the celebration-worthy yet heartrending message we received from a teenager in Nigeria. Thank God today for this young man and all those who have found life through His Word this year. Pray for those who must worship Him in secret. May His Spirit strengthen them and encourage them when they feel alone.

**A pastor in Angola is struggling with secret sin. Pray with us next time.**
