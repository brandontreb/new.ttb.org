 Who is God to you?


December 21, 2021




Yesterday on our journey through Serbia, one listener praised Jesus as our King of Kings. Today in our study of Leviticus 25, Dr. McGee helped us get to know Jesus Christ as our Kinsman-Redeemer and ultimately our Provider. That’s what this listener of THRU the BIBLE in India is praising Him for. Celebrate with us.

*“Six years ago, we were nonbelievers and had never heard about Jesus Christ. My husband and I were very disturbed because we did not have children after four years of marriage. We had taken a lot of treatments from doctors, but nothing worked and our problems were increasing.* 

*“One day someone from our village shared about the power of Jesus Christ and the gospel of salvation. They asked us to start listening to your program in our language of Gondi. The first thing we came to know was the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. After some months, we gave our life to Him. We continued to learn from the program and prayed to God. After three years of prayers, God blessed us with a child. Today we have two children by the grace of God. We are grateful for His provision in our lives, but more important we are grateful for His saving grace. In Him we have found everything we need.”*

King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Emmanuel, Protector, Provider, Almighty God, Alpha and Omega … as we prepare to celebrate Jesus’ birth, reflect on the many things He is to you as you worship and adore Him today.

**God’s Word is helping listeners conquer sin and selfishness in Gujarat. Travel with us tomorrow as we praise Him.**
