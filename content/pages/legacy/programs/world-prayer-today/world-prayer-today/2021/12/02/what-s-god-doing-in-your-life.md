## 
 What’s God doing in your life?


December 02, 2021




***Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.*** -Philippians 1:6 

As our journey of prayer and praise continues, we stop in Italy and meet with a listener named Lucius.

*“I was 13 when I first discovered what I was doing was sin—a very bad sin, too. I wanted to change and live according to God’s rules. But evil was winning the battle within me. One day I met a sister who attended a church, and she helped me understand and believe that God is merciful and forgiving. I turned to Him and was forgiven. For a while I felt free. After some time, I gradually returned to my old, sinful ways. My life was up and down. Finally, by God’s grace, I came to understand and believe that with God’s help I could overcome them. I prayed for God’s help and asked Him to do it because I couldn’t. Since that time, God has been changing me, and I believe He will complete His work.”* 

 As you pray today, do so with confidence. Rejoice in the work God is doing in your life and in the lives of our fellow brothers and sisters around the world.
