 What to do when you doubt


December 31, 2021




Are you suffering with feelings of inadequacy or doubt? Give your heart to God and let Him sort out the rest. That’s the lesson we learned a few months ago as we studied the story of Moses in Exodus, and it’s the same story we hear from this listener of THRU the BIBLE in West Africa. He shares:

*“I am in a time of trials and uncertainty, and I am doubtful. I do not know what to do and feel incapable of making even the smallest of decisions. Today’s teaching in Exodus touched me personally because it reminds me the Lord is with me at all times and that He ensures my protection, so I shall fear nothing! Through His Word, God shows me He will never abandon me. All the glory be to God.”*

What a terrific lesson to learn. Let’s thank God now and ask Him to lead all of us in times of uncertainty.

*Thank you, Lord, that James 1:5-6 tells us if we lack wisdom, we can ask You and You will give it generously. When we are doubt, lead us in the way to go so we can glory and bring honor to Your holy name. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

**The adventure continues on Monday. Let’s pray our way through 2022!**
