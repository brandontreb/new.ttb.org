 “I’m still a Muslim … but not for long.”


December 06, 2021




*“I live in a Muslim village and belong to a Muslim family, but I’ve always been curious about Jesus.”*  
  
That’s the good news we hear from Marinela in Albania. Here’s more of her story:

*“Information on Christianity is scarce in my area. But over the past three months, I have listened to* Thru the Bible*. It’s such a motivating and positive program. I’m learning about Jesus and His life. Thanks to all of you for sharing all this truth! During these very hard days of insecurity, I’m finding a ray of hope in the Bible. I’m still a Muslim … but not for long. I am ready to accept Jesus and begin a new life.”*

More than 1.8 billion Muslims don’t know Jesus. As we praise God for His work in Marinela’s life, pray more followers of Islam will be curious about Jesus, too. 

**We’re praising and praying our way through the end of 2021. Join us tomorrow in Ethiopia.**
