 A listener in the Middle East asks tough questions


December 27, 2021




As we’ve prayed our way across the Muslim world this year, we’ve asked God to soften hearts to the love of Jesus. And He is! Listen to this story we recently heard from a listener named Adnan.

*“I am Muslim and have three wives. Marrying many wives in the Muslim religion is normal. I am a businessman. I have just become a regular listener to the* Thru the Bible *radio program and listen every evening. I now close my shop at 8:30 PM so I can study with you. All lessons are relevant for the people like me who do not have knowledge of Jesus Christ. I need to learn more and more what the Bible says and hope I will get a copy of the Bible soon. I need your advice on what I have to do concerning my wives. Also, I need your advice so desperately to follow the criteria to receiving Jesus Christ, please!”*

Isn’t that amazing? Keep praying, team! And keep asking God to give THRU the BIBLE’s local teams the courage, wisdom, and discernment they need to keep preaching the gospel and counsel listeners like Adnan who ask for their help.

**Our praise and prayer countdown continues tomorrow in South Africa. Until then, may God’s blessings be with you.**
