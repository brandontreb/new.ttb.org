 It’s risky to follow Jesus in Jordan


November 03, 2021




Buckle up, prayer travelers, today we’re headed to Jordan. 

While technically the Jordanian constitution allows for religious freedom (as long as Islamic law and public morality are not violated), the reality for believers is different. As Tala, a listener who joins us on the Bible Bus in Arabic, tells us:

*“Your episodes are the bright light in my dim world. I have been suffering because of my faith in Christ. My family is against me. They want me to return to Islam, but I am strong. I am not able to leave my house without an escort or meet with any other Christians. Your teaching helps me understand the Word more and to love my Lord and live my life for Him. Pray my family will come to know the Lord and will understand my desire to serve Him.”*

Praise God for His Word heard in Jordan. With a population of more than 10 million, experts tell us fewer than 2% follow Jesus Christ. Pray for Tala and all those who bravely follow Jesus despite the risks. Ask God to bless THRU the BIBLE’S programs heard in Arabic. May millions of lives in Jordan and throughout the Middle East be changed as they hear the name of Jesus.

**We’re praying against opposition tomorrow in Qatar. Come along as our journey through the Middle East continues.**
