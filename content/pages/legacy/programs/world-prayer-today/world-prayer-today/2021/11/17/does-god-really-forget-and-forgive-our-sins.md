 Does God really forget and forgive our sins?


November 17, 2021




***“You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You.”*** -Isaiah 26:3

Does God really forget and forgive our sins? That’s the question a listener in Poland asked us on World Prayer Today in September, and it resonated with Rita in Oregon. Here’s her email:

*“The World Prayer Today email today really helped me. I often struggle with looking back at the past. The Lord has used the listener in Poland and our study of Genesis to help me. The story of Lot’s wife looking back and turning into a pillar of salt filled me with understanding. I understand now that I need to be focused on today, which is all I have to give Him, and it comforts me.”*

Today, pray that all those on the Bible Bus are able to keep their focus on the Lord. Thank Him for the reminder in Isaiah 26:3 that when we keep our minds on Him, like Rita, we will be comforted by His perfect peace.

**Who did Jesus hang out with? The answer inspires a young woman in Greece to believe in Him. Hear the story tomorrow.**
