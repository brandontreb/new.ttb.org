 Praise God for His promise in 1 John 4:4


November 08, 2021




Today on the Bible Bus, Gregg and Steve took a few minutes to share some new and exciting things happening with God’s Word around the world. Have you hopped aboard yet? If not, catch today’s study [here](https://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/custom-player/).

Want to know what else is exciting? What God is doing with his Word in Malawi. Rejoice in this letter from a woman named Annie, and then pray for her and others trapped in worshipping Satan:

*“In primary school, I got involved in Satanism through my friend’s influence. I had a friend that was close to me, and the two of us were very much rooted in this vice. My involvement in Satanism made me become very rude to my parents, and my friend left her parents. Currently I finished secondary school. I have heard the Word of God and have been touched. I need your prayers. I am failing to leave this evil life but want to stop completely. I would also like you to pray for my friend who left her parents, that the hand of the Lord would touch her and convict her of her sins.”*

Praise God for the power of His Word. Pray today for this young lady and all those involved in the dark practices of Satanism and the occult. Pray the glory of the gospel overcomes the resistance of those hearing the truth; and for the name of Jesus to transform the hearts and minds of those who have been blinded and deceived. And for those of us who worry about Satan’s power in our lives, may we not forget God’s promise in 1 John 4:4—“He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.”

**Tomorrow we’re off Somalia. See you there as we pray for the growing underground church.**
