 Gregg Harris tells us why your prayers for THRU the BIBLE are important


November 15, 2021




*“Keep praying! It has an effect, and we get to be stakeholders in the spiritual fruit God produces from our prayers.”*  -Gregg Harris, THRU the BIBLE president

It’s time to celebrate! Join us every day between now and the end of the year as we share the miraculous stories of the power of God’s Word in our lives and rejoice in the way His grace and mercy have changed the hearts of our fellow listeners. To get us started, Gregg has a great one from a Bible Bus passenger named Chris Langham. 

Watch Gregg’s encouraging message: 

  
Yes! Today thank God for the privilege of praying together. And if you’ve got a story of how God is using THRU the BIBLE and the World Prayer Team in your life, let us celebrate with you. Email us today at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#317378737d74736462716565731f5e4356).  

**What was your life like before you knew the Lord? Join us tomorrow as we praise Him for all the new brothers and sisters who have joined us on the Bible Bus this year.**
