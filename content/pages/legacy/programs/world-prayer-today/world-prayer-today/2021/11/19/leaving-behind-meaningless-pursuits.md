 Leaving behind meaningless pursuits


November 19, 2021




***Now godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.*** -1 Timothy 6:6-7

Our journey of prayer and praise continues today as we visit with a listener named Ashok in West Bengal, India. He tells us:

*“I am 55 years old, married, and I have a grown son and daughter. My wife and I are alone at home now. I was born in a non-Christian family and had a very materialistic perspective on life. All my years of seeking wealth never left me satisfied.* 

*“By the grace of God, I happened upon your program, and this has been the clarity I needed to escape from meaningless pursuits. I found Jesus and understand how incorrect my principles were. My heart’s desire now is only to know Jesus more.”*

Praise God for this new brother and for the clarity His Word brings to all of us. Thank God that in Him alone we find everything we need to live a meaningful life—including forgiveness for our sin and an eternity with Him.

**There’s more to celebrate next week. We look forward of praying and praising alongside you.**
