 God’s Word is causing “problems” in Qatar


November 04, 2021




***Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”***  -John 14:6

If we’ve learned anything from our previous travels to Qatar, it’s that living as a Christian and sharing your faith in this Muslim-dominant country is beyond difficult. In fact, out of the few emails or letters we receive, many are filled with anger, like this one from Osama:

*“God is one and only. Stop spreading lies. Your program is filled with nonsense and is causing problems for many people. They are beginning to question many things.”*

Praise God for the “problems” His Word is producing! Pray for all those who hear THRU the BIBLE in the Middle East and Qatar. May the truth about Jesus change their hearts, minds, and lives as one by one they turn to Him in saving faith.

**A student in Lebanon finds Jesus on YouTube. Pray with us tomorrow.**
