 “I found Jesus on YouTube”


November 05, 2021




The surprising way God catches the attention of His people is always fun to hear. Here’s a great story from Antoine in Lebanon. 

“*I’m 21 years old and found your teaching on YouTube. That’s when I met Jesus. I grew up in another faith, a very strict faith, but glory to God He has shown He is not in that church but in my heart and in the Bible. Thank you so much for what you are teaching me. Please do not stop.”* 

As we pray for more people in Lebanon and the Middle East to find Jesus in the many creative ways God makes Himself available, tell us your story too. How is our time in His Word changing your life? Is He making Himself known in new and amazing ways? Write to us today at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f2b09b909e97b08781b2a6a6b0dc9d8095).

**Meet us next time in Malawi as a young woman asks for prayers as she walks away from her involvement with Satanism.**
