 “We hear the voice of God in the simplest of things”


November 11, 2021




***Truly my soul silently waits for God;******from Him comes my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense; I shall not be greatly moved.*** -Psalm 62:1-2

As we go THRU the BIBLE together this week, has a particular verse or passage stood out or taken on new meaning for you? John, a listener who lives in a small fishing port in Mozambique called Inhassoro, tells us why Psalm 62 is his new favorite:

*“Every day I learn new things with these wonderful lessons! Today I felt a great desire to invite my brother to listen to this meditation with me. We opened to Psalm 62, and he heard about God as our rock and our salvation. It changed his life. He is now grateful for the certainty of his salvation. Thank you for this teaching. Simple people, as we are, hear the voice of God in the simplest things. And we see Him move throughout the day. Thank you for helping us to know Him better.”*

Isn’t that great? As we intercede for God’s Word as it goes out in Mozambique, also ask Him to help all of us hear His voice in the simplest things and see Him move throughout our day as well. Like John, may our hearts be open to God’s continuous presence in our lives.

**Have you been to Zimbabwe? Head there tomorrow as we travel on our knees.**
