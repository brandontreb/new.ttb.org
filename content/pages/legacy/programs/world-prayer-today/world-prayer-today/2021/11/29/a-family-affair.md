 A family affair


November 29, 2021




***“And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.”*** *-*Deuteronomy 6:6-7 

*“Mama, tell me more.”* 

That’s what Jackson tells his mom every morning at breakfast. Here’s more of what his mom, Ingrid, told us in her recent email: 

*“As we sit and eat together (my husband, me, and our two children ages six and two), I tell them what Dr. McGee has taught, but in story form. Sometimes I have him open his children’s Bible to the passage and we read it together.* 

*“Jackson says he now finds the Bible interesting and when he is older he wants to listen to the program and read the whole Bible. I pray that he and all the children of those on the Bible Bus will always be thirsty for God, for a Savior.”* 

What a great prayer! Let’s join Ingrid in asking God to bless the youngest in our Bible Bus family. 

*Thank you, Lord, for all those who faithfully study Your Word. Help us live what we are learning and model it each day. Help us be the kind of parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, neighbors, and friends who inspire children around us to please and follow You because that’s what they see lived out in our lives. In the precious name of Jesus, amen.*
