 “We had a fear-based relationship with our gods …”


November 25, 2021




*“We had a fear-based relationship with our gods.”*

That’s what we hear from Deepak, a father in Chhattisgarh, India. Here’s the rest of his beautiful story.

*“I am a farmer in a small village. We are a family of four. Following the traditions of old, I always participated in worshipping the graven images of our countless gods and goddesses. We had a stringent prayer schedule during the course of the day. This was our way to appease the gods and keep them happy. We were afraid of their wrath and their curses. I regularly fasted and prayed for blessings, but to no avail. I saw no difference or blessing in my life because of these gods. I also was struggling with a drinking problem.* 

*“Once a pastor visited our village to pray for a sick woman and to distribute program guides. The program guide read in the front ‘for peace of mind, listen to* Thru the Bible*.’*

*“I tuned in that very evening and, true to the words, I had peace in my heart. I began to listen regularly. I had an inner struggle because even though I believed in Jesus, it was hard for me to understand why I had to leave other gods. I called your office one day and finally understood from the brother explaining on the other end that Jesus is the one true God. I am now a Christian and fully committed in a church. My family also followed in my footsteps and are now believers. Thank you for your programs.”*

Praise God for His Word that is reaching into big cities and small villages in India. Pray more people in Chhattisgarh hear of the peace and hope found only in a relationship with Jesus Christ. 

**We’re celebrating tomorrow in Bihar. We’ll meet you there.**
