 A listener in Zimbabwe is excited to reach out with God’s Word


November 12, 2021




*“I have a passion for God’s Word and spend most of my free time sharing it with others.”* 

That’s the encouraging note we received from Samuel, one THRU the BIBLE listener in Zimbabwe. He continues:

*“Your programs help educate me and help me reach out. I share your teaching regularly and people tell me that they too have begun to listen. Please pray more souls in Zimbabwe will be saved and for God’s Word to be heard throughout our country.”*

That’s a great request! As we join him in this request, let’s ask God to give us a passion like Samuel’s. May we too reach out to those around us with fresh excitement about God’s work in our lives.

**On Monday we begin a journey of praise and celebration that takes us to the end of 2021. We have a lot to be grateful for! Join us in celebrating the many ways God has answered our prayers this year.**
