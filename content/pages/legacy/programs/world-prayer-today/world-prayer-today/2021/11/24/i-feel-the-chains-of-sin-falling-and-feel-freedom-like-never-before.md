 “I feel the chains of sin falling and feel freedom like never before …”


November 24, 2021




Your prayers are making a difference. Celebrate what God is doing in the lives of listeners like this one in South Africa: 

 *“**I gave my life to the Lord last year. I am a truck driver, so I travel a lot. After accepting Jesus as my Lord and Savior, I heard a lot of strange teaching and almost walked away from faith. But then I started reading the Bible. I was confused and didn’t understand much. That’s when I found your program. The teacher was speaking on Genesis, and I began to listen. Since understanding God’s Word, my life is not the same. I feel the chains of sin falling and feel freedom like never before. May the good Lord bless you. Thank you for speaking hope in our lives.”* 

 What a story! As you thank God for this miracle today, keep praying others in South Africa will be transformed by the power of His Word.

 **It’s a privilege to pray and praise alongside you****. Tomorrow we travel to Chhattisgarh, India**.
