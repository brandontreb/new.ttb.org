 It’s time to celebrate in Bihar


November 26, 2021




***”******If you abide in Me, and My words******abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.”*** -John 15:7 

 *“I accepted Christ, and today I am a believer.”* 

 Isn’t that terrific news? Together let’s celebrate the rest of the email sent to us from Somdan in Bihar, India. 

 *“My experience with this program cannot be expressed in words. Though I was living a good life, you helped me realize I was not doing what pleases the Lord. The teaching in John 15:7 about me abiding in the Lord and Him abiding in me made a huge difference. I know this can only be done by studying His Word regularly. I now want to share my experience with others and encourage them to listen as well. Please pray that I will be a useful instrument for the glory of my heavenly Father.”* 

 What a great request. As we thank God for this new brother, ask Him to use each of us for His glory and His purpose today and every day as we seek to follow Him. 

 **We’ll celebrate God at work again next week right here on World Prayer Today.**
