 “Sometimes a little discomfort is exactly what the soul needs.”


August 11, 2021




*“Sometimes a little discomfort is exactly what the soul needs.”*   


That’s wisdom we hear today as we meet with a listener who tells us why Angola needs good theology and Bible teaching. Here’s more of her email: 

*“It is not uncommon for the Bible and dark practices to be mixed here. Your messages are challenging those who attend both witchcraft and Christian services. Pastors use your teaching to give them credibility. In short, you are creating a bit of good havoc. Thank you for pushing us and opening our eyes.”*   


Good havoc, isn’t that great? Today pray Hebrews 4:12 and thank God for His living and powerful Word, able to pierce even to the division of soul and spirit and discern our thoughts and intents of our hearts. Ask Him to free more Angolans from the power of dark practices. And while we’re at it, ask Him to show us the realities of our thoughts and motivations. May we please Him above everything else.  

**Come praise God with us tomorrow in Cameroon; you don’t want to miss it!**
