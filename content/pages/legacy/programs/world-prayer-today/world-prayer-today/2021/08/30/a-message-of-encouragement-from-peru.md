 A message of encouragement from Peru


August 30, 2021




***“All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.******Go therefore and******make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,******teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am******with you always, even to the end of the age.”***-Matthew 28:18-20

*“You are my brothers. You are my partners. I pray for you every day. I ask God to bless His Word. I ask Him to awaken hearts of people all over the world.”*

That’s the start of an encouraging message we received from Edith in Peru. She continues:  


*“I listen to you every day on* *Radio Red Integridad here in Lima, Perú. I am filled with joy hearing God’s Word, and my hope is renewed that His name will be praised in far off places.* 

*“The older I get (I am now in my 60’s), the more urgent I find the great commission. I pray for you, for your ministry, for your family, and of course for God’s Word to be heard by more people each day. May God bless you.”*

We thank God for prayer partners like Edith and you, too. Keep praying for God’s Word heard in Spanish and more than 130 languages worldwide, and keep praying for each other. 

**Who does God use to accomplish His purposes? Join us on our prayer journey through Ecuador tomorrow to find out.**
