 Two-thirds of churches in Hong Kong are without a pastor


August 24, 2021




***Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.*** -Matthew 5:6 

 Today we’re praying our way through Hong Kong, which literally means “fragrant harbor.” This city-state does indeed boast one of the finest harbors in the world. What we find as we travel a little further is that while Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places in the world, only 15% of the land is populated.  

 While Hong Kong citizens experience more religious freedom than any city in China, less than 10% are Christians and more than two-thirds of churches are without a pastor. This leaves many open to looking for whatever spiritual leaders and idols offer to fill the void. As one listener recently told us: 

*“I have grown through your teaching and pray earnestly for your ministry! I pray that God’s hand will keep these studies going so brothers and sisters and non-believers may hear this truth. I once was spiritually starving with no place to go to fill my hunger. Now I am fed on a daily basis. I have introduced my fellow church members to this program, and we study together. Such good teaching feels like a luxury to us. We understand its value and are grateful.”*   


As we ask God to bless THRU the BIBLE as it goes out in Cantonese and Mandarin today, pray God’s Word satisfies all those who are spiritually hungry. While we’re at it, thank Him for those leading the church in Hong Kong and ask Him to multiply their impact. May each church have a pastor who loves God’s Word and is committed to sharing it.
