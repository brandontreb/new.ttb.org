 Come praise God with us in Cameroon


August 12, 2021




***I will sing to the******Lord******as long as I live;*** ***I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.*** -Psalm 104:33

Need a little encouragement today? Here’s an uplifting social media post from a listener of THRU the BIBLE in African English:

*“All praise to God our King. In Him we find salvation. In Him we are given eternal life. In Him we are heirs to the throne of grace. Thank you for the many things you have taught me and the many things I have heard from God Himself as we have studied His Word. My life has been changed, and now I sing His praises morning, noon, and night. May you be blessed for your obedience in teaching His Word.”*

What are you praising God for today? The breath in your lungs? The joy in your heart? The gift of His grace in your life? Tell Him all about it today. As you do, ask Him to fill more hearts with His Word in Cameroon and throughout Africa.

**Tomorrow a listener in the Democratic Republic of the Congo tells us what she’s learning on the Bible Bus. Hear her answer and share yours, too.**
