 “I was an idol worshipper and completely against Christians, but …”


August 19, 2021




***Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.*** -2 Corinthians 5:17

*“I was an idol worshipper and completely against Christians, but God got a hold of me anyway.”*

That’s what we hear from one listener in Uttar Pradesh, India. He continues:  


*“I was having some problems in my family and a neighbor told me about your program. Without knowing it was religious, I started listening and couldn’t stop. By the time I learned it was Christian teaching, God had already spoken to my heart revealing my pride, anger, etc. That day I surrendered myself to Jesus and accepted Him as my Savior and Lord. Since then, I left all my bad habits, and I now worship Jesus and attend church regularly. It’s as if I’m a completely new person. Seeing these changes, my entire family has started listening too. One by one they are declaring Jesus as the Lord of their lives. As a family we feel at peace and satisfied in a way we never thought possible. Thank you.”*

Praise God for His grace in the life of this young man and his entire family. Pray more people will hear THRU the BIBLE in their heart language of Hindi and experience the truth of 2 Corinthians 5:17 for themselves.

**What book of the Bible grabbed your attention and brought you to your knees? A listener in Tamil Nadu tells us his surprising answer tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
