 “Please keep teaching, I am listening.”


August 31, 2021




*“God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty.”* -Dr. J. Vernon McGee 

As the Bible Bus rolls through Exodus 3 today, we’re learning when God redeems us from weakness, He always redeems us to His strength. That’s also the story Jorge in Ecuador shares: 

*“God saved me from the filth in which I lived. I was lost in drugs and alcohol, but I could hear His call and I responded to Him. I now live a life free from addiction and according to His Word. You have been a great help at the time when I needed it the most. Please pray as I find that He is now using me to help others like me. I do not feel capable, but I am surrendered to His plan. Please keep teaching, I am listening.”* 

Thank God He can use each of us according to His plan. As you pray for Jorge today, pray for how God might use you today, too.  

And as His Word goes out in Ecuador, especially in the indigenous language of Quichua, pray more people will hear His call and accept the new life He offers them through a relationship with His Son, Jesus. 

**We’re making a special stop in Haiti tomorrow. Travel with us as we pray.**
