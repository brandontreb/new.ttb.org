 “It is never too late to begin again with God.”


August 10, 2021




***Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.***-Philippians 3:13-14

As the Bible Bus continues to roll through the Gospel of Matthew, we learn today that Jesus often used stories to share important truths. That’s also the hope of Kosso, a listener in Chad who shares his story:

*“I have faced many difficult moments because I chose to indulge in sin instead of following our Lord. I thought I was lost for good until I heard Dr. McGee’s messages of grace and instruction on how I can return to God. I am now restored and have risen above. I am grateful for your ministry that has brought me peace and understanding of how to follow Jesus. I pray the Lord will use you in many lives to bring others to repentance and real faith. It is never too late to begin again with God.”*

Praise God for second, third, and fourth chances. Today, intercede for those who need to pick themselves up and begin again. Pray God’s Word will give them strength and courage. 

And if you know someone who is struggling to move forward, share Dr. McGee’s free booklet, [“Forget About It: How to Put the Past Behind You,”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_forget-about-it.pdf?sfvrsn=d91a1e16_2) today.

**God is doing good things through His Word in Angola. Join us tomorrow and hear all about it.**
