 Praying through challenging terrain in Timor Leste


August 05, 2021




Off the beaten track. That’s how many describe the southeast Asian country of Timor Leste (previously known as East Timor). Travelers are few and most visitors find themselves here for business, diplomatic, or development work.  

 So, prepare to blaze a trail through what seasoned travelers call adventurous and challenging terrain, and get ready to pray for the many difficulties the Timorese face each day. To remind us, here are a few of the heartbreaking things we discovered in our previous travels. 

 * The Timorese people are caught in a vicious cycle of poverty, poor health, and illiteracy. The average worker makes $1.20 per day.
* Timor Leste has one of the highest rates of violence against women and girls in the Asian-Pacific region.
* The streets are flooded with children and young people who have nothing and are recruited into dangerous gangs.
* The majority of Timorese claim Christianity as their religion. However, most remain ignorant of the gospel.

Let’s pray together now: 

*Father, in developed countries like ours, we seldom think about the blessing of food, clothing, and a safe place to live. Today, we thank You for these basic necessities in our lives and pray for the Timorese who are without. We know the plight of homeless children breaks Your heart. Please protect those living on the streets, the families who can’t make ends meet, and draw more to your Word where they can find hope for tomorrow and healing from a violent past. Guide each Timorese heart into the fullness of life You long to give each of us in Your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.*

***We’re praying James 1:19-20 in the Philippines tomorrow. Come along and join us.***
