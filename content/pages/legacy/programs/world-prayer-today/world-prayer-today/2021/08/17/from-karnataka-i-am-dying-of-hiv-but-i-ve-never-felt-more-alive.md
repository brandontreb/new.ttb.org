 From Karnataka: “I am dying of HIV, but I’ve never felt more alive."


August 17, 2021




Are you overwhelmed? What difficult things are you facing today? Job stress? Family pressure? Health issues? A listener named Rajamma in Karnataka, India, shares a word of encouragement.

*“My husband died 15 years ago of AIDS. During his sickness, family members abandoned us and upon his death, I was alone. Now I am dying as well, however I have never felt more alive. I have listened to your programs and have accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. At your urging I found a church close to where I live, and they have become my family. On days I am not well, you are my companion. God wipes away my tears as I listen to His Word and become more deeply rooted in my faith.”*

Isn’t that beautiful? God is good even in our most difficult circumstances. Pray more people in Karnataka and all over the world find the lifesaving, life-giving truth about Jesus Christ and then His companionship and compassion. Whatever they face today, pray they turn to Him and, like this listener, let Him dry their tears and root them deeply in their faith and trust in Him.

Is life tough right now? Find more encouragement from God’s Word when you download Dr. McGee’s free booklet, [“For Those Who Grieve.”](/docs/default-source/booklets/ttb_for-those-who-grieve.pdf?sfvrsn=cd431f16_2)

**We’re praying in Punjab tomorrow. It won’t be the same without you, so hop aboard.**
