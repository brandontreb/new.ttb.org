 We’re making a joyful noise in Cuba today


February 12, 2021




**Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth! Sing out the honor of His name; make His praise glorious. Say to God, “How awesome are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies shall submit themselves to You. All the earth shall worship You and sing praises to You; they shall sing praises to Your name.** *-*Psalm 66:1-4

We are singing God’s praises today as we make our way through Cuba. A listener named Sergio leads us in this worship:

*“Your teachings are good and our God is great. Let’s praise Him for His glory and pray more Cubans join us day by day. May the grace and peace of the Lord always be yours and sustain you and strengthen you in your commendable work for Him. I ask everyone on the Bible Bus to stand up, sing, and shout His praises for His provision and grace that follow us all the days of our lives.”*

Yes! Make a joyful noise for the Lord today. Thank Him for His goodness in your life and praise Him in confidence for those in Cuba He is drawing to Himself through His Word.

**We’re grateful for your faithfulness in prayer. Join us next week as we intercede for God’s Word to make a difference across Central Asia.**
