 A listener in Albania tells us how God opened his eyes


February 25, 2021




**Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things from Your law.** -Psalm 119:18

*“I had eyes, but I couldn’t see. God’s Word has opened them to His holiness and love.”*

That’s the good news we hear from Agron who lives in the Muslim-dominant nation of Albania. He continues:

*“I was lonely, you gave me company. I was thirsty, and now I am satisfied. I am a child of God. Your program has opened my eyes, and I’m very blessed to know Him now. Each day, I learn more about Him. The Word of God is so clear and good, explained by the speaker. May you be blessed for your work.”*

Today thank God for this listener and all those who are turning to Him in faith. Pray His wonderous Word will open more eyes and hearts in Albania and in Southern Europe. Like Agron, may they too discover the joy of knowing Him and being His child.

**Tomorrow we’re praying for God’s Word to be a refuge for Christians in Kosovo. We look forward to praying with you.**
