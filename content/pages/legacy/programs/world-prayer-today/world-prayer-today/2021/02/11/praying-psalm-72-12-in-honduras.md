 Praying Psalm 72:12 in Honduras


February 11, 2021




**For He will deliver the needy when he cries,** **the poor also, and him who has no helper.** -Psalm 72:12

*“This program is a jewel. I’m just discovering the depths of the Bible. Instead of old stories, I’m finding real information for my life. Thank you.”*

That’s the great news we hear from a listener in Honduras. As we pray today, let’s thank God that His Word is changing hearts and lives throughout Central America and the Caribbean. And as we do, let’s lift up the many physical needs Hondurans struggle with, especially children. Here are a few hardships to keep in mind.

* Honduras is the second poorest nation in Central America and one of the poorest in the Western Hemisphere.
* More than two in five rural families live in extreme poverty and don’t know where their next meal will come from.
* Many children experience a limited childhood because they have to go to work, often in exploitative conditions.
* More than half of the population are children, and the streets are full of orphans and unwanted children who get pulled into gangs or the sex trade out of desperation.

We’re thankful for your prayer support and for the promise in Psalm 72:12. Praise God that when we equip adults and children alike with the Word of God, they can put their lives in perspective and learn how to trust God in all of life. 

**Join us tomorrow as we sing God’s praises with a listener in Cuba.**
