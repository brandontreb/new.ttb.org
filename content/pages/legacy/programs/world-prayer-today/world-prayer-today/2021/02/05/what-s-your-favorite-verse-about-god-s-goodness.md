 What’s your favorite verse about God’s goodness?


February 05, 2021




*“I am passing through many difficulties and I feel like there is no earth below my feet. Please, I need your prayers.”*

That’s what we hear from a listener from Mozambique today as our prayer trek through Western Africa continues. She tells us more:

*“As a child I was taught when we accept Christ, there would be no more trouble. But I realize now it’s not like I was promised! I thought about abandoning God altogether, but I listened to your programs and have realized God is with me even though I feel as though I want to die. Thank you for explaining that as Christians we will have difficulties, but we can face them with the hope of Jesus Christ. This has changed my thinking. Please pray for me and please keep teaching God’s Word. Your messages are a help in these sad days.”*

The Bible is filled with verses about how God cares for us and upholds us in the middle of our fear and worry. What verse do you immediately think of? Perhaps Psalm 91:14-16, Zephaniah 3:17, Lamentations 3:22-23, or how about Jeremiah 32:27? Use one of these or your favorite Bible verse about God’s goodness to pray for this listener and all those who are struggling in Mozambique and around the world. 

**Next week the World Prayer Team heads to Central America and the Caribbean. Rest up this weekend and join us for the journey.**
