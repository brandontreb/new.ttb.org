 Good news from Costa Rica!


February 10, 2021




**Therefore do not be like them. For your Father****knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.** -Matthew 6:8

As we’ve traveled the world, one of the most beautiful spots we’ve enjoyed together is Costa Rica. The lush rain forests, the white sandy beaches—there’s so much to love. 

Welcome to World Prayer Today. As we praise God for His beauty here, we also praise Him for the beauty found in the hearts of His people. More and more of them are joining us on THRU the BIBLE. Let’s share a few of the things they’ve recently told us: 

From Manuel: *“Quarantine was so much easier because of your Bible School. Thank you for helping us grow closer to God at home.”*

From Serena: *“Lovely words from lovely people. Thank you for your explanations that have helped me realize the heart of God. I was struggling over family matters, and His Word has lifted me.”*

From Jonas: *“Your podcast has been a tool from God for healing me from depression and suicide attempts. I can only give thanks to God for you and the way you teach the Bible.”* 

Thank God He knows our need before we ask. Pray more people in Costa Rica begin to study His Word and experience His grace and mercy today.

**Tomorrow we head north to Honduras. Pack a bag and meet us there!**
