 A personal message from Uganda


February 04, 2021




*“There are a lot of Muslims in this area. At night some come privately to confess their faith in Jesus because they’ve heard His Word on* Thru the Bible*.”* -Pastor Benjamin 

Isn’t that great news? Travel with us, faithful prayer warriors. Today we’re in for a special treat. Watch this video  
of THRU the BIBLE’s Pastor Benjamin in Uganda and thank God for His goodness and His answers to our prayers in Uganda today. 

  
**We’re praying God’s Word over listeners in Mozambique tomorrow. Grab your Bible and join us.**
