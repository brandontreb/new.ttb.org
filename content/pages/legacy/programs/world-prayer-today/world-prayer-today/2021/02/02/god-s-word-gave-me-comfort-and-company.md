 God’s Word gave me comfort and company


February 02, 2021




God is faithful. That’s what we heard from Dr. McGee in our study of Revelation 7 today, and it’s also what we hear as we travel on our knees in Zambia. A listener named CeCe shares:

*“I heard your programs in the hospital just when I needed them. God’s Word gave me comfort and company. I never used to fully believe in God, but now I wonder. The nurse that cares for me tells me God is faithful, we can trust Him. I want to know more about this. Can you tell me how I can listen to your programs when I return home?”*

Today, let’s thank the Lord for all those who share His love with others. Nurses, teachers, co-workers, neighbors, and friends, pray for these brothers and sisters as they share God’s Word with all those they encounter in their work and daily life. What a great witness!
