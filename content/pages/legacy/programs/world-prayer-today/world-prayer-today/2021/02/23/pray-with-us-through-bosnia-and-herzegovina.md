 Pray with us through Bosnia and Herzegovina


February 23, 2021




**Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.** -Matthew 7:7

If we chose one word to describe the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it would be *divided*. One country, two governments, three ethnic groups, and many religions.

Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we land in the capital city of Sarajevo, we meet with a fellow passenger on the Bible Bus who ask us to pray for her country. She says:

*“Before I started listening to* Thru the Bible*, I didn't know much about God’s Word. I read a little when I had free time, but often I didn't understand it. It is different now, because I am systematically studying the Scriptures and receiving useful guidance, interpretations, and explanations. I pray that God continues to speak to me and work through this program and on the hearts of many others who seek Him. He said seek and we shall find. Please pray many more will use this privilege we have to seek Him, because through these programs we find God and get to know Him better. It’s what our country needs to heal right now.”*

What a wise woman. God is what every country and every person needs right now. Pray more people in Southern Europe will seek and find Him through His Word heard on THRU the BIBLE. 

**God is at work in Greece. Join us tomorrow as we praise Him and pray more people will hear His Word and respond in faith.**
