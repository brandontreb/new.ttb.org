 Praying in one of the most oppressive countries in the world


February 19, 2021




More than 80% of Turkmenistan is desert. Hot, dry, and completely desolate.

Welcome, World Prayer Team. If you’ve been traveling with us for a while, you’ll recall the spiritual landscape is just as bleak. With no freedom of religion or press and strict government oversight in all areas of life, Turkmenistan is widely considered one of the most oppressive countries in the world.

However, God’s Word heard on THRU the BIBLE cannot be so easily controlled. Rejoice in this email from a listener who wishes to remain anonymous:

*“This program is most helpful. From you I receive spiritual food, support, and I learn new things. The most important is the fact that it directs me to God. Especially these days when it is difficult to keep our faith and it is difficult to grow. Your teaching overcomes these issues. There are not many places where one can hear such truth. Please keep going.”*

God is at work in Turkmenistan. Thank Him today for answering our prayers. Keep asking Him to protect our brave brothers and sisters who believe in Him despite the risks, and rest in the knowledge that He is using THRU the BIBLE to draw more Turkmen to Himself.

**Have you ever wanted to experience the sights and sounds of Spain? Join us on Monday as we travel there on our knees.**
