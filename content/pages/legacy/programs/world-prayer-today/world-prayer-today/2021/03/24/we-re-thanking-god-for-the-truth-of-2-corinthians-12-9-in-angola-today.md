 We’re thanking God for the truth of 2 Corinthians 12:9 in Angola today


March 24, 2021




***And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.******”*** -2 Corinthians 12:9  


 As Gregg and Steve tell us today on [THRU the BIBLE](https://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/custom-player/), there is a lot of confusion surrounding Christianity in Angola. Thankfully, God’s Word is making a difference in the lives of listeners like this one: 

 *“My mother abandoned me when I was a child. I was taken care of by my grandmother and have lived a life that does not please God. I do not think I have the strength to turn my back on evil practices and my friends who are a part of this life, but through your encouragement I am considering it.*

*“I am often depressed, but you have given me a reason to live. Please pray that I will have the courage to change my life. Please pray that I will live for Jesus. I know I am too weak to do this on my own, so I need God’s help.”*

 These are big requests, but we serve a bigger God. Thank Him today for the promise found in 2 Corinthians 12:9. As we lift up listeners like this one, pray with confidence that He will meet them in their weakness and give them His strength and courage to walk away from the darkness and into the light of His love and grace.   


**There’s more to pray about tomorrow in Gabon. It’s a privilege to pray alongside you.**
