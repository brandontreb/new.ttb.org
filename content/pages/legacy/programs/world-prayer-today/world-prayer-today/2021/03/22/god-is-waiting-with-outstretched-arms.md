 God is waiting with outstretched arms


March 22, 2021




***But******when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.*** -Luke 15:20

As we travel through middle Africa this week, we stop and visit with a listener who struggles with something that may hit close to home. Listen to her story and see if it reminds you of someone you know … maybe even yourself.

*“I am twenty-nine and have been married for three years with two children. At the beginning of our marriage, I was engaged in prayer with my husband. After the birth of our children, I felt completely overwhelmed between home, work, children, and our relationship. Now, I cannot find time to pray and read my Bible.*

*“My husband on the other hand still prays a lot, and I envy him so much for that. I feel very bad because Jesus was once my favorite. Today I am lost, and it saddens me enormously. I have started to listen to your programs and spend time with the Lord again. Please pray I devote more to the Lord and develop a new pattern and routine in my life. I am empty without Him.”*

Praise God for His outstretched arms waiting to embrace us when we return to Him. As you study His Word today, ask His Spirit to work within the hearts of all those who have lost their way. May they too be reminded of the precious fellowship He offers each of us when we take the time to enjoy His presence in our daily lives.

**We’re praying through the Democratic Republic of Congo tomorrow. We’ll see you there.**
