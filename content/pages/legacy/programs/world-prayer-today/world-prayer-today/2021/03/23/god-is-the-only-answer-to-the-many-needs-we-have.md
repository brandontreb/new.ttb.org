 “God is the only answer to the many needs we have.”


March 23, 2021




*“There are truths in the Bible I have never heard.”*

That’s what we hear from one listener named Camille in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). He continues:

*“I have listened to your programs on the book of Amos and am amazed. God’s Word is deeper and more important than I thought. I am praying God will open my ears to hear more and I will understand it. We are at a critical point in our country, we need God and He is calling us. He is the only answer to the many needs we have.”*

God *is* calling out His people today. As we bow before Him, pray that more people in the DR Congo will hear Him. Like Camille, may His Word change their hearts and may His name be praised throughout their land.

**We’re thanking God** for **2 Corinthians 12:9 tomorrow. Travel with us as we pray for Angola.**
