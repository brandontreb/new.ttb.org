 “I lost a friend but gained Christ.”


March 31, 2021




*“**During the pandemic, a lot of people I know had losses. But for me, I gained Christ."*

That’s the good news we hear from a listener in Turkey. His story continues: 

*“I’ve listened to your programs for a year now. At the beginning I was collecting information, but in time something started to change my heart.* 

*“After I lost a friend to Covid-19, I was devastated. I started to ask more questions about the future and about life after death. I looked many places, but I didn’t find any answer that covered my fear during this time. So, I listened to your programs with a new attitude and found a freedom I had never experienced. I decided to give my heart to Christ and now I know what will happen to me, even if I die. Thank you for the answers to questions I never knew I had.”*

Thank God for His saving grace in the life of this listener and our own. Pray more people in Turkey and around the world hear the Good News and respond in faith today. 

**Come back for more good news tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
