 “Can you tell me the real story of Jesus?”


January 04, 2021




From a hot air balloon safari over the Serengeti, to an expedition to see the ancient rock-cut churches of Ethiopia, there is always something exciting to see and do in Eastern Africa. There’s also a lot to pray about.  


 Welcome, World Prayer Team. Eastern Africa is home to nearly 550 million people God loves, many who have never heard His name. Let’s remember them before the Lord today and thank Him for His Word heard on THRU the BIBLE that reaches listeners like this one in the language of Amharic.  


 *“Can you tell me the real story of Jesus? I do not have a religion. However, I believe there is a God who created earth, the universe, and human beings. I just don’t understand how we can know Him. I was listening to the radio and found your program while tuning stations. The programs in Genesis are intriguing. Please keep teaching, as I am listening and have so many questions.”*

That’s the greatest request we can receive, and our travels are just beginning! 

**Grab a hat and sunscreen—we’ll pray our way through** **Central America and the Caribbean tomorrow.**
