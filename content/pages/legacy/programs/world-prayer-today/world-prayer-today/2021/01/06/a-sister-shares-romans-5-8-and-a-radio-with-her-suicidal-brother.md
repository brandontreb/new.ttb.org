 A sister shares Romans 5:8 and a radio with her suicidal brother


January 06, 2021




**But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.** -Romans 5:8

Surveillance, church raids, and complete control over printed materials. These are the restrictions many Christians live with in Central Asia. And former Muslims choosing to follow Jesus are often persecuted by the state, family, friends, and their communities. 

 Despite the darkness, God’s Word is prevailing. Want proof? Listen to this amazing story from a listener in Kazakhstan.

*“I'm a believer. I listen in secret to your programs. During quarantine, my younger brother and his wife had problems. She left him and took the children. I do not know what happened between them, but he called me and said he wanted to kill himself. I drove quickly to see him. I took my radio with me.* 

*“When I arrived, I could see my brother was very depressed. I told him about the love of God and recited some verses I know from Romans. My favorite is Romans 5:8. Then I told him about your programs. I wanted to give him the radio, but he didn't accept. I talked to him and left.* 

*“After a few hours, he called me and asked for the radio. He began to listen to you that day. A couple of weeks later, he called me and asked me to come see him. When I arrived, he said he wanted to repent and be forgiven. We prayed together, and he accepted Jesus Christ.* 

*“I have no doubt my brother would have killed himself. He is a proud Kazakh man and very headstrong. I give God all the glory for saving his earthly life and giving Him eternal life as well. Thank you for your programs that helped me know how to talk to Him. My brother and I will be listening. Please pray his wife will come home.”*

Thank God for the power of His Word and the hearts of His people like this caring sister. Today, let’s pray that God’s Word flourishes in more hearts and families in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. May the good news of Romans 5:8 overcome any doubts or fears they may have.

**Tomorrow a listener in Albania examines her life in light of God’s Word. What she finds is important to us, too.**
