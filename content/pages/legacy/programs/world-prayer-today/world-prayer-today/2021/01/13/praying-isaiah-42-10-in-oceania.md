 Praying Isaiah 42:10 in Oceania


January 13, 2021




**Sing to the****Lord****a new song, and His praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it,** **you coastlands and you inhabitants of them.** -Isaiah 42:10 

 Pristine conditions, beautiful islands, and out of this world marine life. That’s what we’ll see today in our journey across Oceania. So, grab your sunglasses in one hand and your Bible in the other, and let’s get started praying Isaiah 42:10 for all those who live here, including Maxime who tells us: 

 *“For two months, I turned on the radio to listen to you at 4:30 AM. I am a non-Christian, but I have a Bible and am reading it with you. I like how you explain the Scriptures, and I listen with all my heart. I have begun to feel a change in my life and wonder if this is the Lord moving within me.”* 

 Praise God for the way He uses His Word to draw us close to Him. Lift up Maxime and those in Oceania who hear His Word. May their hearts be changed and with their lives may they sing a new song of praise as they come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and King. 

 **Tomorrow Enkhmaa in Mongolia shares her great God story. Invite a friend to join you at [TTB.org/pray](http://www.ttb.org/pray).**
