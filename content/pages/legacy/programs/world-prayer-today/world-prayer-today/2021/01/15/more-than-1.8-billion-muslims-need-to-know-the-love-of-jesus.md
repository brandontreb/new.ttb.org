 More than 1.8 billion Muslims need to know the love of Jesus


January 15, 2021




More than 1.8 billion Muslims need to know the love of Jesus. That’s what we’re praying about today as we make our way through North Africa.

Together let’s lift up those living in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Western Sahara, and Tunisia. Many call this region tough terrain to plant the seeds of God’s Word, but while some remain resistant to God’s Word, others like Saeed are drawn to it. Here’s his story: 

*“Hello, I’m a Muslim. I have been listening to your radio program for several months now. Can you send me a real Bible? Here in Morocco, I don’t know where to get one. Jesus has been on my mind and in my thoughts for a long time. I want to know Him more.”*

Today pray for Saeed, pray for all those who are open to God’s Word in Northern Africa, and pray for our in-country follow-up teams. And then praise Him. God is answering our prayers and is working in His time to bring His people to Himself.

**A family battles Covid-19 and clings to Isaiah 40:29. Join us on Monday as we pray our way through South America.**
