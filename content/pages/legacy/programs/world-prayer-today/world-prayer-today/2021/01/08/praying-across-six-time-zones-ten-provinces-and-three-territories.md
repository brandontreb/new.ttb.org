 Praying across six time zones, ten provinces, and three territories


January 08, 2021




**Blessed are those who****hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.** -Matthew 5:6

Spread across six time zones and boasting a spectacular diversity of landscapes, the country of Canada is known as a playground for travelers. 

As we travel on our knees across Canada’s ten provinces and three territories, we make a quick stop to stretch our legs in Ontario.   


Larger than Spain and France combined, the province of Ontario is home to 40% of Canada’s population. It’s also home to many immigrants, including Jenny who joins us on the Bible Bus in Arabic. She shares: 

*“Thank you for your program and for your prayers that are making a difference in my life. I have not been a Christian long, but I see my life changing so fast, and I am seeing the hand of God moving already. When I realized the love and sacrifice of Jesus on my behalf, it changed everything. I became starved to learn more. I couldn’t get enough of God’s Word. What a pleasure it was to come across your programs that taught me to pace myself and slowly digest the truths.*

*“Please keep praying for others to hear these programs, and please pray I will be able to tell my family about what I have come to experience and witness.”*

Yes, pray forTHRU the BIBLE’slanguage broadcasts in Canada, including those in English, French, Arabic, Spanish, and more. As God’s Word goes out, may more people get on the Bible Bus with us each day. Let’s also ask Him to give listeners like Jenny the courage to share their faith with those they love most.

Would you like to share the gospel with a family member or friend? We’d love to help you get started. Visit TTB.org and click on [How to Know God](https://www.ttb.org/resources/how-can-i-know-god). We pray these free resources guide you as you share God’s incredible gift of salvation with those you’ve been praying for. 

**Our adventure continues on Monday in Myanmar. Join us on your knees.**
