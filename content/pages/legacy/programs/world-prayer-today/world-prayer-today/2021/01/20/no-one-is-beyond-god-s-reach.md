## 
 No one is beyond God’s reach


January 20, 2021




More than 188 million people live in the Middle East, and most of them are Muslims. But not one of them is beyond God’s reach. Jesus died so they, too, can enjoy a rich life with Him for now and throughout eternity. That’s exactly what we hear from Mansoor, who sent us this text.

*“I cannot tell you where I live, but I can tell you I was taught to know the Quran backwards and forwards. Even with all this knowledge, I felt dead inside.* 

*“One day I heard your program on the radio. I was curious and listened again. It was as though I found a treasure. I felt alive and vibrant. I wanted to share this feeling with others and tried to visit a church in my area, but I wasn’t allowed. My family is very powerful, and the risk to the other Christians was too great. I understood, but my heart was heavy.*

*“Now I listen with you on the radio, and I learn more than I could have imagined. To my very core, I am for Jesus and will stay with Him until the end. Pray I will be able to live with the expectations of our Lord and that someday I can share the gospel with many.”*

As we travel on our knees today, thank God for the curiosity He is placing in hearts throughout the Middle East. Pray more Muslims like Mansoor tune in to THRU the BIBLE, turn away from the thief that seeks to kill and destroy, and turn to the One who offers them a full, satisfying, and abundant life (John 10:10).

**Eastern Europe is our destination tomorrow, pray with us.**
