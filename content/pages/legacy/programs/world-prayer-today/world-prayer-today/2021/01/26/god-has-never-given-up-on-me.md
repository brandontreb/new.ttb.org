 “God has never given up on me.”


January 26, 2021




**Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.** -Philippians 3:13-14

Traveling through the USA and its territories today, we stop and meet with Agustin in California who reminds us that God’s goodness is undeserved, and His saving grace is a miracle in all our lives. Here’s his story. 

*“I’ve been a listener for eight years, and I’m continually amazed at the way God speaks directly to me through His Word. I can’t remember a time when I haven’t struggled with alcohol and heroin. I’ve been shot, incarcerated, and disowned by my family, but God has never given up on me. He’s worked on my heart through every single hardship. I am undeserving, and it just doesn’t matter to Him.*

*“After years of walking with Jesus and listening to your programs that show me how, I am now a changed man. I have a wife and son and eternal future with our heavenly Father. If you would have met me long ago, you’d understand that each of these is a miracle in itself.”*   


God’s forgiveness and grace is a miracle we can all celebrate. Today pray more people in the United States ask God to rescue them from their past and give them a future and a hope through a relationship with Jesus Christ. 

If you or someone you know is struggling with letting go of past sins and moving ahead with the miraculous new life God offers, download Dr. McGee’s free booklet, [“Forget About It: How to Put the Past Behind You.”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_forget-about-it.pdf?sfvrsn=d91a1e16_2)

**Does your family have a prodigal? We’re praying for them as we travel on our knees through Southern Europe tomorrow. We hope to see you there.**
