 Are you growing in the Word?


October 08, 2021




“God’s Spirit works progressively in our hearts. He brings us along in maturity, growing us up in Christ. Our salvation happened in a moment, but our sanctification happens over a lifetime.” -Dr. J. Vernon McGee

“Pint-sized and packed with adventure.” That’s how many travel experts describe the country of Belize. As our prayer adventure begins in this gorgeous country, we meet with a listener named Cece who shares:

*“My husband and I have been listening to you for nearly a decade. I have recently found some notes I made from the early days, and the growth in my understanding of God’s Word is exciting. I’m grateful to God for continuing to deepen my faith and my knowledge of His Word. We now invite neighbors to listen with us. Please keep teaching. Our desire is to be more like Jesus in all that we do and to be more equipped to do His good work in the world.”*

Praise God for this faithful couple. As we intercede today, ask God to bless them as they study His Word and share it with others. And, as we’re on our knees let’s ask Him to grow us up too as we learn about and love Him.

**A lot is happening through THRU the BIBLE Home Groups. Join us on Monday in West Bengal.**
