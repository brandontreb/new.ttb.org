 “I have found my life’s purpose in loving and living for the Lord”


October 05, 2021




With more than 700 islands and 2400 cays all bordered by spectacular coral reefs, you’ll want to grab your sunscreen and wide-brimmed hat today, as our World Prayer Team takes off for the Bahamas.

We begin our tour in the capital city of Nassau, as we meet up with one THRU the BIBLE listener named Christiane. She says:

*“I am 30 years old and accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior within the last year. At first, I heard your programs and then I couldn’t find them. Now I listen on YouVersion. I’m so grateful for this app. I have finished listening to Joshua and now am studying Philippians. What treasures are to be found in God’s Word. His Word is more precious to me each day. Knowing it, I am a different person. I am radiant, I am filled with joy. I have found my life’s purpose in loving and living for the Lord.”*

Praise God for this listener and all those in Central America and the Caribbean that study His Word. As we seek to know Him better, may we too find our purpose in loving and living for Him.

**Two friends in Grenada connect over God’s Word. Hear their heart-warming story tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
