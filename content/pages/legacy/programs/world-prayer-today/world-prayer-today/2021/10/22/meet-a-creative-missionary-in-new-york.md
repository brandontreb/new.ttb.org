 Meet a creative missionary in New York


October 22, 2021




***And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying,******“All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.******Go******therefore and******make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,******teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am******with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.*** -Matthew 28:18-20

*“Where should we take the gospel? Everywhere… that’s my goal.”*

That’s the exciting opening of an email we received from Daniel, who catches the Bible Bus in New York City. Here’s more: 

*“I have been studying the Bible with you in Spanish for four years. I have long wanted to greet you and thank you for the incredible blessing you have been, as well as a group I meet with on Zoom from several different countries. There are more than 35 of us, and we invite more each day. Some invite neighbors, some invite family members, some invite people on internet groups they belong to. We continue to pray to be part of your mission of taking God’s Word to the world. Zoom can go anywhere, so we’re praying more and more Spanish-speaking people will join us. Thank you for this opportunity and for each study that brings us face to face with our Father.”*

Pray today for these creative missionaries and all those who are sharing God’s Word around the world. May God find each of us faithful to His commission.

**We’re praying our way through Western Europe next week. Meet us on Monday in Belgium.**
