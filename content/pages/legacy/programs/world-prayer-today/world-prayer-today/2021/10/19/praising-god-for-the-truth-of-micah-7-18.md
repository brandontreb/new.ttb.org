 Praising God for the truth of Micah 7:18


October 19, 2021




***Who is a God like You,******pardoning iniquity and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He does not retain His anger forever, because He delights in mercy.***-Micah 7:18

Welcome to Puerto Rico! Today we’re celebrating God’s mercy in the life of a listener named Javier. Here’s his story:

*“At the moment, I am confined in a federal prison. I grew up in a church that practices many rituals instead of focusing on a relationship with Jesus. I believe in God. I believe Jesus is His Son and our Savior, but I didn’t really understand what it meant to know Him personally.* 

*“At the age of 25, I began to distance myself from the church. I began to put my work first, to generate income, and I began to neglect my relationship with God, with my wife, and with my children. At one point I preferred the relations at my lover's house more than at my house with my beloved wife and kids.*

*“I fell to the bottom of the abyss when I was 33 years old and imprisoned, and it is here where I met again with Jesus my Savior. After 8 months in prison, in January 2020 I got on the Bible Bus and the 5-year cycle was beginning. I have already enjoyed the detailed study of Genesis, Matthew, Exodus, and the first 13 chapters of Mark.* 

*“Each day I fall in love more with the God of our eternal salvation. I look forward to continuing on this Bus for many more decades. I also want you to know God is faithful to me in so many ways I don’t deserve. My wife has stood by me. She forgave me and did not abandon me and is supporting me while I go through this ordeal. She waits, along with my two children, anxiously awaiting my return which has no date yet. God had many reasons to hold their anger against me, yet He has shown me mercy each step of the way. What a blessing.”*

God is good. Today thank Him for the truths found in Micah 7:18. Praise Him for His mercy in Javier’s life and all those He loves and calls His own. Ask Him today to show each of us how we can make Him known to those around us.

**We’re praying** **Psalm 67:3-5 over the Navajo Nation tomorrow. Meet us in the southwestern U.S.**
