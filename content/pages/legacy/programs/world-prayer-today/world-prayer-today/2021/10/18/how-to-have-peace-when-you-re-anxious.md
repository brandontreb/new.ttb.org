 How to have peace when you’re anxious


October 18, 2021




***Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.***-Philippians 4:6-7

The apostle Paul knew about living through difficulties. Yet, in the face of persecution, prison, and even impending death, he chose to trust in God and encourage others. That’s also the story we hear today from a World Prayer Team member named Karen. Here’s her recent email:

*“I checked our prayer tour this morning and it was just the encouragement I needed. On Thursday I will be having biopsy surgery to check for possible uterine cancer. This was very unexpected over the last few weeks to find out there might even be an issue.*

*“I have been fighting anxiety about it all and yet trusting the Lord to help me through whatever comes (including the actual procedure and recovery). I will continue on the Bible Bus, studying and praying as we travel. It is an honor to ride with you and our team.”*

Pray Philippians 4:6-7 for our fellow travelers who face unexpected and unsettling circumstances. Believe in confidence that God will give them an unexplainable peace to guard their hearts and minds—peace that acts like a company of soldiers to protect and defend them. Ask Him to show them evidence of His grace and care each day as they turn to Him with their worries and fears.
