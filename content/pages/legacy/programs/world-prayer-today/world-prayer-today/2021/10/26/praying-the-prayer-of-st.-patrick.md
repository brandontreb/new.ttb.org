 Praying the prayer of St. Patrick


October 26, 2021




***Christ with me,  
Christ before me,  
Christ behind me,  
Christ in me,  
Christ beneath me,  
Christ above me,  
Christ on my right,  
Christ on my left,  
Christ when I lie down,  
Christ when I sit down,  
Christ when I arise,  
Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me,  
Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks of me,  
Christ in every eye that sees me,  
Christ in every ear that hears me.****-*Saint Patrick

Welcome to Ireland.As we know from our previous visits, despite Ireland’s long Christian history, church attendance is dwindling and social issues like alcoholism and suicide plague its youth.

Today as we travel the manymiles of breathtaking coastline, lush green forests, and century-old castles, we ask this amazing prayer from St. Patrick become the heart’s desire of every man, woman, and child In Ireland as well as in our own. As God’s Word goes out on THRU the BIBLE, may it take root in hearts and homes and sweep throughout the country, bringing new faith deep in the hearts of the Irish people.
