 He prayed to thousands of gods, but it wasn’t enough


October 12, 2021




*“Something was missing.”*

That’s what we hear from Santosh, a Hindi listener of THRU the BIBLE. Here’s more of his story:

*“I am from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, India. I worshipped Brahman and thousands of other gods, but it wasn’t enough. I felt empty. That’s when I heard about your programs and began to listen. Now my family sits every evening and listens to the Word of God. We have opened our home as a home group and invite others to study with us. I praise God for His great plan for my family.”*

While Hinduism says the truth cannot be found in any one source, but must be sought in many, the Bible says, “Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Pray today that home groups like this one all over India continue to share God’s Word. As they do, may more Hindus like Santosh abandon their thousands of gods and come into a relationship with the one true God through His Son, Jesus Christ.

**John 15:12 changes the heart of a listener in Assam. Hear his story tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
