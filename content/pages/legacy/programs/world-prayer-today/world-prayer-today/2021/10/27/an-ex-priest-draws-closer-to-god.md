 An ex-priest draws closer to God


October 27, 2021




*“Men have created all sorts of barriers to God. Thank you for helping me break them down.”*

What a great opening to an email we received from Riccardo, who hears THRU the BIBLE from his home in Switzerland. He continues:

*“I’m an ex-priest and I want to compliment all of you for* Thru the Bible’s *programs. I’ve always wanted to be closer to God and now I know how. Each message brings me new understanding of how to faithfully commune with our Lord. How fantastic it is to set aside rituals and revel in His glorious presence.”*

To draw near to our Lord … that’s our prayer for every person who joins us on the Bible Bus.As we pray today for more people in Switzerland to join us, may you, too, draw closer to our Father knowing that He promises whoever seeks Him with all their heart will find Him (see Jeremiah 29:13).

**Ready for a great salvation story? Join us tomorrow in Czechia.**
