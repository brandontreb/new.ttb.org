 It’s a mystery: A message from Gregg Harris


January 28, 2022




***“Go into all the world******and preach the gospel to every creature.”*** -Mark 16:15

 People like you who have been impacted by the teaching of God’s Word on THRU the BIBLE often ask*, “*How can I most effectively be involved in taking the whole Word to the whole world?”**

That’s the kind of question we love to answer. And as World Prayer Team members, the answer won’t surprise you.

The best way we can link arms and be part of what God is doing in our generation is to pray for God’s will to be done through us. *Wait.* *Not tell others? Not financially support?* While those are great secondary ways to come alongside, the primary way for you to make a difference is to pray.

Yes, we know—it’s a mystery. James 5:16 says the prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working. 

So, be sure to join us next week as our journey slows down and we focus our hearts on one country a day. And pray right now for the effective impact of THRU the BIBLE as people listen to it today. Ask Him for many lives to be changed today through the power of His Word. Beginning with each of ours. 

**We’ll meet you on Monday as we pray for God’s people in Zambia.**
