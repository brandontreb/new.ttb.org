 Casting nets according to Luke 5:4


January 04, 2022




***“Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”*** -Luke 5:4 

 It’s a great month to be on the Bible Bus and a great month to travel with the World Prayer Team. As Dr. McGee takes us through the amazing Gospel of Luke, we’re thanking God for using His Word to cast wide nets and develop deep faith in the hearts of listeners like Misael in Mexico: 

*“Although in my 20’s, I have lived a hard life. Drugs, gangs, and violence were a part of my daily activities. After my daughter was born, I knew I needed to look for something different … something more. I found your program on the internet and began to listen regularly. I am grateful to now know Jesus and have begun to turn away from my past. It is not easy to leave this lifestyle, but with God’s Word in my head and now in my heart, I am slowly becoming free.”*

As we journey together, keep praying that God’s Word will take root in the heads and hearts of all those who hear it. In return, may we too obey His call to drop our own nets and follow Him.  

**It’s not easy to follow God in Central Asia. Tomorrow find out how two sisters manage to feast on the Word while they work**
