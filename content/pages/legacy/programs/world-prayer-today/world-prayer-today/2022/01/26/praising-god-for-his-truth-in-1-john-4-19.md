 Praising God for His truth in 1 John 4:19


January 26, 2022




***We love Him because He first loved us*****.** -1 John 4:19 

 God loves us and He wants us to love Him. That’s the message we hear from Denis in Germany. Here’s his recent email: 

*“Growing up I went to Sunday School, but we never talked about God at home. First John 4:19 was the only verse I remembered. Sometimes when I was lonely or scared, these words would come to mind. They always comforted me and calmed me.*

*“Now as a teenager, I have been sent to live with my grandmother. Each day we study the Bible with your programs. I have found that knowing and repeating God’s Word still comforts me. Only now I thank Him for that love and spend time telling Him how much I love Him in return. We used to listen in our language of German, but my grandmother and I rushed through the program. So now we listen in English to make us slow down and catch every word. Even with all that we’ve studied, 1 John 4:19 is no less dear. God loves us … He loved us first. This undeniable fact is enough to change the life of any adult or child.”*   


Pray today for people in Western Europe to discover the transformative power of God’s love. And like Denis, let’s express our love to Him, too: 

*Lord, thank You for Your unconditional and unchanging love. We love you, too. Help us to express it by loving others even when it’s not easy. Let us be your tangible hands, feet, and heart in this world. We want to be a mirror reflecting Your grace to everyone we meet. In the precious name of Jesus, amen.*

**Have you ever been mad at God? Meet us tomorrow as a listener in Southern Africa tells us her story.**
