 “I am no longer Muslim … now my identity is as a son of God.”


January 14, 2022




***For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.*** -Galatians 3:26

 *“In Northern Africa, Islam is not just a religion, it’s a part of who we are. It’s woven into the fabric of our identity.”* 

 That’s what we hear from one Bible Bus passenger in Algeria. He continues: 

 *“To follow Jesus, no matter how devout (or not) we are, we may be giving up our family, our country, and part of ourselves. I did not make this decision quickly; it took much time, prayer and reflection. I am no longer Muslim. I am now wholeheartedly devoted to Jesus. Now my identity is as a son of God, and you are my family.”* 

 Today pray boldly for all those in North Africa who are willing to hear God’s Word and consider His promises. Pray they realize God is ready to give them a new identity, to accept them as His heir, a full-grown son or daughter. One that He loves so much He provided a way to spend eternity with Him.
