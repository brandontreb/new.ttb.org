 God’s got our problems…


January 10, 2022




*“He is the omnipresent God, but at the same time He is ever-present to help us as we face life with its burdens and problems.”*-Dr. J. Vernon McGee 

*“We thank God for you! We are grateful for each one who prays, who teaches, who pays for these programs.”*

That’s the good news we hear from a listener in Vietnam as we pray our way through Southeastern Asia today. She continues: 

 *“We live in a remote area. There are very few other Christian and no church. We now gather in a home and listen together. Thank you for introducing us to Jesus, for helping us understand who He is, and learn how we can fellowship with Him. In Him we have found the answers to many of our problems and look at life differently. I thank God and you for this most gracious gift.”*

 Keep praying, team! In a region where Christians are often the minority, pray more people in Southeastern Asia hear God’s Word on THRU the BIBLE this year and choose to follow Him. As they do, may their burdens seem lighter and their problems smaller because of an omnipotent, omnipresent God who wants to be ever-present in their lives, too. 

 **Did you know God only wants good for us? Hear more tomorrow as we travel through Middle Africa.**
