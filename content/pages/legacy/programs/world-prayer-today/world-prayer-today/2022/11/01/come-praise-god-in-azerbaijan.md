 Come praise God in Azerbaijan


November 01, 2022




God is doing great things in Azerbaijan. As we visit the cosmopolitan capital of Baku and drive through the nearby villages surrounded by apple orchards, we hear how God is raising up an Azeri church that loves Him.

Although there were only 40 known believers living in the country in 1991, today there may be as many as 10,000 (with even more living in Iran). These joyous believers, many from foreign ethnicities, are known to create music, literature, poetry, and other indigenous forms of worship.

Today, thank God for their creativity in praising Him. As we pray many hear Godâ€™s Word through the Armenian broadcast of THRU the BIBLE and join in the number of saints, intercede for sweet fellowship and unity among these brothers and sisters who often come from different backgrounds but serve the same amazing Lord.

**The people of Jordan need Jesus; pray with us there tomorrow.**
