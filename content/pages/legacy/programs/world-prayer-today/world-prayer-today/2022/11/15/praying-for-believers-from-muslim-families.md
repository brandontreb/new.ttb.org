 Praying for believers from Muslim families


November 15, 2022




It’s a great day on the Bible Bus as we begin our study of Romans. If you haven’t already joined us, consider downloading our new [Romans Bible Companion](/docs/default-source/booklets/ttb_romans-bible-companion.pdf?sfvrsn=e1b71816_2) and hop aboard. It’s also a great day here on World Prayer Today as we welcome a new brother from Nigeria to the family of God. Here’s his story:

*“I have no church to attend because I am from a Muslim family, and in my community, Christians are not allowed. Your program in Yoruba is my worship and my study because I cannot tell others about my faith. Please pray for me. I want to be a servant to share my faith with other believers. I know God can make this happen.”*

Your prayers are making a difference! Thank God for all those who are being drawn to the truth through God’s Word. Ask God to answer the prayers of this listener and develop a sweet fellowship of believers who will welcome and support all those who come from a Muslim background.

**From grief to grace. Hear the important story of a family in India tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
