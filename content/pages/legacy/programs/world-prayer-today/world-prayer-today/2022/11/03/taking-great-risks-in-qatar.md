 Taking great risks in Qatar


November 03, 2022




***“Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves.******Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.”*** -Matthew 10:16

In Qatar, converting to Christianity means losing everything, and the small number of believers who do must gather covertly for teaching and worship. Although sharing the gospel with Muslims is strictly forbidden, some Christians still take great risks to evangelize Qatari citizens.  


Today pray for wisdom and discernment for those put themselves in harm’s way to share God’s love and His Word with the more than 87% of Qataris who have never heard His name. Ask God to open doors and soften hearts so His church will grow and flourish in this spiritually barren land.

**A welcome invitation from Lebanon arrives in the mail. Hear more tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
