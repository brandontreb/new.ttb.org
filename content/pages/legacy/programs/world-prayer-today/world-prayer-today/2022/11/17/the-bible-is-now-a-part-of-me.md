 “The Bible is now a part of me.”


November 17, 2022




***For the word of God is living and powerful ….*** -Hebrews 4:12

*“The Bible is now a part of me.”*

That’s the great news we hear from Cristina in Romania today as our journey of prayer and praise continues. She shares:

*“When I first became a Christian, I was lazy and uncommitted. Last year I discovered your programs and began listening constantly. It was easy and they were interesting. Soon I felt I knew God a lot better. I began changing my habits and began attending church more. Before discovering THRU the BIBLE, I learned about the Bible and admired the teachings, but now they are essential to me. It is as if God is using this program to make the Bible real in my own life. What a strange concept that something written so long ago has so much meaning to my modern situation. Only with God can this be possible.”*

Today (and every day) thank God that His Word is living and powerful in our lives. As we study together, ask Him to continue to use it to teach, convict, correct, and instruct us on how we can live our lives for His glory. (See 2 Timothy 3:16-17.)

**Once an orphan, a father muses on his children’s arguments over John 14:2. Hear this touching story tomorrow as we travel to Ethiopia.**
