 What keeps you up at night?


November 10, 2022




***But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.*** -1 Peter 5:10

*“Thanks to you, I have found my security in God.”*

That’s the great news we hear from a listener named Alick as we travel through Mozambique. Here’s more of his story:

*“As I’ve listened, God’s Word has repeatedly reminded us that nothing can afflict me when I give my complaints and concerns over to God. In our country we have many problems, but through these programs I am learning that nothing can shake us when we rely on Him.”*

What worry keeps you up at night? A mounting pile of bills? Health issues? Troubles in your family? Overwhelming deadlines? Pray for all those on the Bible Bus who are facing trials today. Ask God to remind us He is in control and move us from doubt and defeat to hope and peace.

**Why do you study the Bible? Email** [**[email protected]**](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#de9c979c929b9c8b8d9e8a8a9cf0b1acb9) **and tell us. Then join us tomorrow as a listener in Zimbabwe shares his answer on World Prayer Today.**
