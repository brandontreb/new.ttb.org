 The celebration begins


November 14, 2022




***Oh, give thanks to the******Lord******!******Call upon His name; make known His deeds among the peoples! Sing to Him, sing psalms to Him; talk of all His wondrous works!*** -Psalm 105:1-2  


As our 2022 World Prayer journey nears an end, we’re taking the next few weeks to reflect and thank God for what He’s doing in our hearts and the lives of our fellow listeners like Natasa in Serbia who tells us:  


*“I had a friend at work who kept telling me about God and what the Bible says. I put it off thinking it was something I could spend time researching when I was older and retired. In my mind, going to church and reading the Bible somehow was better for those who have ‘nothing else to do.’ However, I began to face a number of problems. They shook my self-confidence and made me admit that I can’t do everything alone. I needed help. I began to listen to your programs and realized I needed God’s help. So, I gave my life to Him. God helped me get out of the problems I was in, and I am so grateful to Him for that! At that point, problems didn’t even matter to me anymore because I discovered the real wealth and majesty in my relationship with Him. Thank you for what you do in sharing His Word with us.”*

And join us every weekday through the end of the year as we talk about the wonderous works He’s doing as we travel together THRU the BIBLE. 

**See you tomorrow in Nigeria.**
