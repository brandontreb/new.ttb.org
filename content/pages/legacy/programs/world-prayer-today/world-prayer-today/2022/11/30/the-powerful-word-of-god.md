 The powerful Word of God


November 30, 2022




***But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.*** -1 Peter 2:9

Step into any meeting or eavesdrop on phone conversations with Gregg Harris and Steve Shwetz at THRU the BIBLE and you’re likely to hear several great listener stories each time. Why? Because as Steve has often said, “These letters are living proof that God is blessing His Word.”

So, rejoice with us today that God is at work, blessing His Word as it goes out on THRU the BIBLE in Odisha, India:

*“The power of God’s Word changed my life completely. I was lost in sinful actions, wanting to enjoy life with all the attractive things the world was offering. My desires led me to the habit of drinking alcohol, and I was in the company of wrong friends. Though I wanted to enjoy all these pleasures, I never had peace. I felt that I was useless in society. I wanted to get rid of my bad habits, but I was not able to do it on my own.*

*“One day one of my relatives introduced me to* Thru the Bible *in my language of Oriya. In the beginning, I couldn’t understand much about the Word of God, but as I continued to listen, God started speaking to me directly about my sinful nature. I put my trust in the Lord and prayed to Him for deliverance. God helped me to live a victorious life. Now I am no longer in the bondage of sin. These great changes took place in my life because there is power in the Word of God.”*

**There is power in the Word of God! Let’s sing it, say it, and shout it from the rooftops today. Then join us tomorrow as the journey of praise continues.**[Listen here to TTB-Oriya.](https://ttb.twr.org/home/day,0419/language,ORI)
