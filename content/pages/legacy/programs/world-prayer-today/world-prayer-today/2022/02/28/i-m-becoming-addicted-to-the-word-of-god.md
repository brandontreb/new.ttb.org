 “I’m becoming addicted to the Word of God”


February 28, 2022




In our study of Numbers today, we learned that God wants us to find joy in Him. And joy is exactly what Armando shares as the World Prayer Team travels through Canada today. Here’s his story. 

*“Who knew God’s Word is incredible?*

*“I listen in Spanish and learn something new each time. I jump on your website to move ahead or catch a lesson I miss. I’m becoming addicted to the Word of God.”*   


Thank God for this fellow Bible Bus passenger and all those who are so passionate about studying with us. Pray more people in Canada (and each of us) find the same joy in knowing Him better and meeting Him in His Word each day.

**It’s a privilege to pray with you. Meet us tomorrow as the journey continues.**
