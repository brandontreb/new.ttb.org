 How to finish well


February 23, 2022




***Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.***  -2 Corinthians 5:9-10 

*“I want to finish well.”* That’s what we hear today from a listener named Katerina as we pray our way through Greece. She continues: 

*“I am 80 years old this month, and I’ve had 2 Corinthians 5:9-10 on my mind. Whatever I do in my life now, I want it to be pleasing to God. His love keeps me going and keeps me young at heart. I really want my grown daughters to come closer to God. I listen to you every day and will continue. May God’s hand upon you continue and more people hear His Word.”* 

Praise God that regardless of our age, His Word continues to encourage us to live for Him. Also thank Him and pray for our in-country teams who answer phone calls, emails, texts, and fulfill requests like Katerina’s. May God use His Word and their faithful service to draw people in Greece salvation in His name. 

**Are you in a season of suffering? Be encouraged tomorrow by a listener in Albania.**
