 Meet a fan of Jesus in the Dutch Caribbean


February 08, 2022




If you hop aboard the Bible Bus today, you’ll hear Gregg and Steve talk about some amazing things God is doing through His Word. You’ll also hear them thank you, our World Prayer Team members, for your faithfulness and partnership. Together we are storming heaven’s gates, thanking God for opening doors and asking Him to bless us as we reach more listeners like this one in the Dutch Caribbean:

*“God’s Word is SO GOOD! I am a new listener and plan to continue on with you through the entire Bible. Today I was touched by hearing the nine things that made the Lord Jesus unique. Just like in a stadium, I stood and cheered. I am now a fan of the Lord. I have never heard such things explained in such a clear manner and have rededicated my life to serve Him.”*   


Keep praying, team. God is faithful to answer. And if you too are a raving fan of God, tell Him today. You don’t have to stand and cheer like this listener, but I’m sure He’ll love it if you do. 

 **Tomorrow in Costa Rica we meet a new Bible Bus passenger. Help us welcome him aboard and hear his incredible story.**
