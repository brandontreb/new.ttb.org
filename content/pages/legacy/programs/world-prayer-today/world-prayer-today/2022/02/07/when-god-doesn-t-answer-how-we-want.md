 When God doesn’t answer how we want


February 07, 2022




***“For My thoughts are not your thoughts,******nor are your ways My ways,” says the Lord. “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.”***  -Isaiah 55:8-9   


God doesn’t always answer our prayers in the ways we want, but He always has our best interest at heart. That’s the message we hear today from Leon as the World Prayer Team travels to Nicaragua today. Here’s his story: 

*“I feel very happy to be a part of the family that goes through God’s Word. For many years I prayed and sought a way to go to a Bible Institute. However, financially I was not able. Then I found your program, and it’s so much more than I ever could have imagined; instead of just me going to learn, my entire family gets an education.* 

*“When we have breakfast, the whole family listens to the daily message, and it is superb. It’s super good to feed our spirit in the same way we feed the body. We are prepared for whatever the day may bring us or whomever the Lord puts in our path. God truly knows what we need and makes a way for us better than what we plan. May the Most High God pour out of His blessings to all who make this program possible.”* 

Today praise God for families like Leon’s … those who love God’s Word and make it a priority in their lives. Let’s also thank Him that His thoughts are higher and His ways are better than we can imagine. 

**Meet a fan of Jesus tomorrow in the Dutch Caribbean. Be forewarned: His enthusiasm is contagious.**
