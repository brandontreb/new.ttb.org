 Celebrating the benefits of consistent Bible study


February 10, 2022




***I have more understanding than all my teachers,******for Your testimonies are my meditation.***  -Psalm 119:99 

 If you’ve been on the Bible Bus very long, you already know the value of time and energy spent regularly reading and studying the Bible. That’s also the wisdom Gustavo from Honduras shares today: 

*“I am only 23 years old, but because of my parents I have listened to you for more than 15 years. As a young child my parents prayed Psalm 119:99, asking God to give me wisdom beyond my years and 2 Timothy 3:16-17 so that I would be equipped to live for God. I’m grateful for the foundation they have given me and also for your consistent teaching that continues to nourish me. As I prepare to study at the university, I feel prepared to begin a life of ministry.”*   


As we pray for more people in Honduras to spend time in the Bible each day, take a minute to write down a few ways you can thank God for His Word in your life lately. Have you been fed and strengthened? Encouraged? Corrected? Directed? Convicted? There are so many, many benefits … thank Him for all of them. Then, share them with us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#317378737d74736462716565731f5e4356), too.  

 **We’re praying for the next generation of believers tomorrow in Cuba.**
