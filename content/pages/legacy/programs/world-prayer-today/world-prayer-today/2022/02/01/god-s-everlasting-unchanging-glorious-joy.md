 God’s everlasting, unchanging, glorious joy


February 01, 2022




***Your words were found, and I ate them,******and Your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart.***  -Jeremiah 15:16 

 One of our hopes for you as you board the Bible Bus (and come before the Lord in prayer) is that you enter God’s wonderful joy-filled presence and experience His joy for yourself as you worship Him. That’s exactly what a listener of THRU the BIBLE in Zambia has found. Here’s her story:  

*“My friends and I listen to* Thru the Bible *in our language of Shona and have been transformed. Studying the Word of God has become a craving. We find much joy as we gather together around it. Nothing brings us as much satisfaction as learning the Word and walking in the path the Lord has set before us.”*   


Isn’t that encouraging? As 2022 unfolds, pray for more people in Zambia (and each of us) experience the same thing. When we draw close to God through His Word, may our hearts be filled with His joy.    

 **We’re praying Ephesians 1:18-19 in Eritrea tomorrow. Invite a friend to come along.**
