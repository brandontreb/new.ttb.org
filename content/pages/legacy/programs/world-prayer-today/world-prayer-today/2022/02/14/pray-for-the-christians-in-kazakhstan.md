 Pray for the Christians in Kazakhstan


February 14, 2022




***And it shall come to pass that******whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.***  -Acts 2:21 

 Our journey through Central Asia this week begins in Kazakhstan where we meet with a fellow THRU the BIBLE listener who shares: 

 *“I’m outside of my house now. I go outside every day and listen to your sermons. I’m not allowed to listen at home. They’re not believers. I am alone in my faith. But your programs support me.”*   


It’s true. Bible believing Christians are a small but growing minority in Kazakhstan. Today as you pray for this isolated listener and others, let’s also use Acts 2:21 as our guide to pray for His family and others in Kazakhstan to hear God’s Word and call upon His name: 

 *Lord, thank You that everyone who calls on Your name will be saved. We pray the Kazakh people will call on Your name as a result of having Your Word. Save these people for Your glory! Bring them great delight in gathering together as families and communities to worship You. Grow Your church, Lord, for Your glory. In Jesus’ name, amen.* 

 **God is on the move in Kyrgyzstan; let’s stand back and watch in amazement tomorrow.**
