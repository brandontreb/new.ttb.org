 “I’m getting back to my first love, Jesus.”


April 20, 2022




***“And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.”*** -Deuteronomy 6:6-7

When we travel together through northern Africa, we often hear from believers who are ostracized or persecuted by their families for their faith in Jesus. Today as we pray our way through Egypt we’re refreshed and encouraged by a woman named Hala who writes:

*“Since childhood, my father has gathered us around the radio to listen to your Bible teaching. After several years of being astray, I found you online and I’m getting back to my first love, Jesus. All that I’m listening to seems like it’s for the first time and it’s bringing me closer to the Lord! I love the program and I love the Lord who allowed me to find you again to regain my love and trust in Him.”*

What a great family. Today let’s praise God for faithful parents around the world and ask the Lord to bless them as they raise the next generation of the church. 

**Tomorrow we hear the opposite story from a young man in Morocco. Join us as we pray.**
