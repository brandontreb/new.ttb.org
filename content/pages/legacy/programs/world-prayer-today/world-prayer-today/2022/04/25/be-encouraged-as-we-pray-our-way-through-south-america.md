 Be encouraged as we pray our way through South America


April 25, 2022




***Oh, how great is Your goodness,******which You have laid up for those who fear You, which You have prepared for those who trust in You in the presence of the sons of men!*** -Psalm 31:19

Welcome to Venezuela. It’s our deepest desire that as we pray across South America this week you’re encouraged and inspired by the faith of our fellow listeners. Today Rueben tells us:

*“I give thanks to God for this beautiful ministry and the lives He has brought together because of it. Thanks to you I have learned a lot in the last three years and grown closer to my Lord. I pray each day this program is a blessing to thousands of people just like me. When I began with you, I listened alone. Now, praise God, my wife studies with me and accepted Christ as her Savior when we were in the book of John. Together we thank God for His goodness which led us to you and the riches found in His Word.”*

God is so good! Make a list today and tell Him all the ways you are grateful for who He is and what He does. While you’re at it, thank Him for the hearts of fellow listeners like Rueben and his wife. Ask God to bring more people in Venezuela aboard the Bible Bus as we learn from His Word and praise Him together.

**Our prayer journey tomorrow takes us to Bolivia where a new listener reminds us of God’s promises.**
