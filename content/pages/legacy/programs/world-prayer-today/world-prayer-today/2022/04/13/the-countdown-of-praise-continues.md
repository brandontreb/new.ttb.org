 The countdown of praise continues…


April 13, 2022




As our countdown to Resurrection Sunday continues, we stop in Gujarat, India, and praise God for the work He is doing in the hearts of Bible Bus passengers like this one:

*“In my family’s religion, we have hundreds of gods and goddesses that we are supposed to worship. It’s exhausting. There is no peace. I came to know about THRU the BIBLE from a friend. It has been two years since I began listening, and I love God’s Word more each day. I am now a Christian, and I get up early in the morning to study with you before I go to the university for my studies. Your program has always given me good insights. It has helped me to build my life. Since I have begun with you, my entire family has now followed.”*

Although Gujarat is the birthplace of Gandhi, there is little evidence of the peace and tolerance he promoted. Christians are harassed and persecuted by Hindu extremist groups with support of the local government and police. Despite this, God’s Word prevails. Thank Him today for those who come to salvation as a result of hearing about Jesus on THRU the BIBLE. Continue to pray that His truth taught in the language of Gujarati brings many to believe the good news of Jesus Christ. 

**“I’ve found what I’ve been longing for.” Tomorrow a listener in France has good news to share. Hear his story on World Prayer Today.**
