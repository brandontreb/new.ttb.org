 “When I am unsure of what is right, I go to the Bible for the answers.”


April 27, 2022




***“Say to the righteous that it shall be well with them,******for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.”*** -Isaiah 3:10

Welcome, prayer team. Yesterday in Bolivia we heard that truth can be hard to find, and today we hear something similar from Argentina. Here’s what Silvia said in a recent email. 

*“Looking for sound doctrine can be like searching for a needle in a haystack. Thank you for your programs that make God’s Word the authority. Now when I am unsure of what is right, I go to the Bible myself and look for the answers. You, of course, make it more understandable, but the truth comes from the book, not from any man.”*

Yes! Today let’s pray for all those hearing THRU the BIBLE in Argentina and thank God that when we are confused or unsure, we can open the Bible and hear directly from Him. Let’s start with Isaiah 3:10.

*Father, thank You for Your Word* *that changes our lives, transforms our hearts and minds, and reveals our deep need for You**. Thank you that no matter what we hear in the world, we can open the Bible and hear the truth directly from You. Help us to hide Your Word in our hearts, knowing that all will be well with us because You are good and faithful. In return, help us reach out to others with Your truth for their good and Your glory. In the precious name of Jesus, amen.*

**Are you ready to be excited about God’s Word? Meet us tomorrow in Brazil.**
