 We have a new brother in Taiwan


April 06, 2022




***“I am******the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”*** -John 14:6  
Spiritually dark. That’s how many visitors describe the island of Taiwan. Pray with us for the more than 90% of Taiwanese who follow a unique blend of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism and for listeners like this one who is looking for something more … something eternal. 

*“I looked to many gods for blessings in this life, but couldn’t find the peace I was looking for. Your program in Cantonese helped me realize the truth about Jesus and to deal with my sins. I have surrendered them to God and choose now to live in light of His teachings. Thank you for showing the way.”*

**We’re praying Acts 26:18 tomorrow in China. Come along for the journey and blessing.**
