 Pray for God to accomplish the “impossible”


April 19, 2022




***Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run swiftly and be glorified, just as it is with you.*** -2 Thessalonians 3:1

Our journey through northern Africa this week brings us back to the vast and desolate country of Western Sahara. As a refresher, Western Sahara is almost entirely Muslim with very few Christian workers and even fewer local believers living among them. More than 90% of the Saharawi people have never heard of Jesus, and experts believe most will likely never hear of Him in their lifetimes. Yet in our travels through God’s Word, we’ve certainly seen God accomplish things man thinks are impossible. 

Moses drew water from a stone. Barren women, conceived. David defeated a giant. A virgin gave birth to the Son of God. These are just a few times the unimaginable was accomplished for God’s glory. Take some time today to add to this list from the Bible and from instances in your life. Then pray using 2 Thessalonians 3:1 as a starting point. Ask God for His Word to run swiftly and glorify Him in the hearts and lives of fellow believers living in Western Sahara. 

**Good things are going on through God’s Word in Egypt. Hear more tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
