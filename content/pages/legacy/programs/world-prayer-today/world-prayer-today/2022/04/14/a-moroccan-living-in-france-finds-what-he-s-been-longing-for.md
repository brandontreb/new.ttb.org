 A Moroccan living in France finds what he’s been longing for


April 14, 2022




*“I’ve found what I’ve been longing for.”*

That’s what we hear from a listener named Saeed in France. Here’s more:

*“Living in Morocco, I never had the freedom to explore different faiths because my family and community wouldn’t allow it. Christianity is a forbidden thing. But after I’ve lived for some time here in France, I’ve found your program and I’ve been learning a lot.*

*“Your systematic, thorough biblical teachings enlightened my mind and my heart. I now would like an Arabic Bible. I have become a follower of Christ and would love to nourish my new faith. Can you point me in the right direction?”*

God is good! As we celebrate the addition of this new brother to the family of God, let’s ask Him to use His Word in Arabic to reach more people in France. With several million speakers, it’s the second most common language in French homes. 

**Join us tomorrow for a Good Friday message of joy.**
