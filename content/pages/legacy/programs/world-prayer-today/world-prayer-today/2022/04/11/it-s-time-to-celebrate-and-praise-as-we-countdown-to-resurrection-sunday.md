 It’s time to celebrate and praise as we countdown to Resurrection Sunday


April 11, 2022




***Oh come, let us worship and bow down;******let us kneel before the Lord our Maker. For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand.*** -Psalm 95:6-7

It’s time to celebrate! This week we’re counting down to Resurrection Sunday and rejoicing in God’s grace as we meet those who have come to the cross of Jesus, believing that He is the Savior. Let’s start today in Uttar Pradesh, India, as Ramsajiwan shares his story:

*“Through your programs my entire family has accepted Jesus as our personal Savior and Lord.*  
  
*“We have found the messages of this program directly go in the inner part of the heart and vibrate the soul. I have never experienced this feeling before.* 

*“I am a student and in my young days I want to live my life according to the Word of God. I know God has chosen me in His love to proclaim His name for His glory. The main thing I learned from this program is that God has created every Christian man and woman for some purpose. And this purpose can only be known and fulfilled in the will of God. I pray God uses me for His purpose in my life. I know I will have to go through several temptations, but I also know that my Shepherd is with me, I rejoice He is my maker.”*

Amen! As you pray today for Ramsajiwan and all those who are joining us in the family of God, let’s also worship and thank Him that we all are the people of His hand and He is indeed our God.

**There’s more to be grateful for tomorrow in Ethiopia. Travel with us to a small, remote village and rejoice in the story shared by a new brother.**
