 Praying big things in Montenegro


July 19, 2022




***Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.*** -1 Timothy 2:1-4

A small country with huge potential. That’s how many describe Montenegro. However, in order to thrive, it must avoid the hatred among ethnic and religious communities that cripples most nations of the Balkan region. 

As we lift up the people of Montenegro, let’s use 2 Timothy 2:1-4 as our guide. God wants all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Pray government leaders work toward a just, peaceful, and corruption-free nation. Also, ask God to reach each man, woman, and child with the truth of Jesus Christ, so they can set aside prejudices and all ethnicities can peacefully and lovingly live alongside one another.

**A churchgoing listener in Italy started reading the Bible and was surprised. Hear her story tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
