 The Bible is filled with surprises


July 27, 2022




***“I will heal their backsliding,******I will love them freely, for My anger has turned away from him.”*** -Hosea 14:4 

*“God’s love is unending and His Word is always surprising.”* 

That’s what Miguel in Mexico says he’s learning on the Bible Bus. Here’s more of his story:

*“God bless you greatly for the wealth you expose through these messages. It is a great blessing for my spiritual life. I am now studying the book of Hosea and seeing it much more clearly than I would on my own. God is so great in love and mercy that He gives us the opportunity to repent until the last moment. I am always surprised at the lengths He was willing to go to save and forgive Israel and know He will do the same for me. I pray more people turn to Him through your teaching.”*

As you join Miguel in that prayer, thank God for His unending love in your life, too. Want a place to start? Use Hosea 14:4 as a guide. Thank Him that He will heal our disobedience, forgive our sins, love us freely, and turn His anger away from us so we can live with and for Him.

Like Miguel, is God Word’s surprising you as we study together? Write to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afede6ede3eaedfafceffbfbed81c0ddc8) and share your story.
