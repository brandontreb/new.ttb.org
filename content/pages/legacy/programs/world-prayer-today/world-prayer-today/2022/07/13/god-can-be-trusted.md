 God can be trusted


July 13, 2022




“***For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand. He knows your trudging through this great wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.”*** -Deuteronomy 2:7

Even when the Israelites wandered through the desert, God had a plan and was working in their lives. So, when we are in the middle of a dry and difficult patch in life, when God seems absent from our circumstances, we too can trust He is present with us. That’s what Oscar in El Salvador recently shared. Here’s his story:

*“I am about to finish the five years of this precious journey through the Word of God. I started on this path when I was going through a desert in my life. Your voice I associated with the voice of my Lord. In the moments of anguish and concern that I was passing through, God’s Word reassured me that He was to be trusted with my life.”* 

What a great reminder. God can be trusted. He is in charge. As we pray for God’s Word going out in El Salvador, also thank Him for the way His Word speaks to us as we study. 

*Father, thank You for your Word that shows us You are with us—guiding, protecting, providing. Even when we can’t see You, we know You make streams flow in the desert and cause roots to grow out of dry ground. Thank You for Your Word that gives hope when all seems lost. We pray those who hear it today in El Salvador will be drawn to You and believe in what they hear about Jesus being the path to salvation. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

**Haitians need our prayers. Our journey through Central America and the Caribbean continues tomorrow.**
