## 
 God’s Word is …


July 20, 2022




*“I grew up in a church of tradition and rituals.* *When I began to read the Bible on my own, I went into crisis. I immediately noticed the differences between what my church taught us and what God’s Word teaches us. I was devastated.”*

That’s the beginning of an email we recently received from Angelica in Italy. She continues:

*“I searched the internet and found your programs. Little by little my crisis passed, and I accepted the truth. Thank you for helping me understand the Bible and what God wants from me. I appreciate you don’t tell us what to believe, you take us to God’s Word that tells us. The legitimate truth is all I want from now on.”*As we pray for all God’s Word will accomplish in the hearts of listeners like Angelica, thank Him for what it means in your life, too. Need some help? Here’s a start—feel free to add to the list as you go!

Thank God His Word is:

* Truth—John 17:17
* Eternal—Matthew 24:35
* Living and powerful—Hebrews 4:12
* Life-giving—Deuteronomy 8:3
* A lamp for your feet, a light on your path—Psalm 119:105
* A refuge—Proverbs 30:5
* Perfect, proven, a shield—Psalm 18:30
* Understanding to the simple—Psalm 119:130
* Jesus, our Savior—John 1:14

**Tomorrow in Portugal we’re praying for senior citizens. Travel with us.**
