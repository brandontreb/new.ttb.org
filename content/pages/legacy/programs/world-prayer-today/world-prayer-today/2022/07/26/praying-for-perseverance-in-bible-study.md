 Praying for perseverance in Bible study


July 26, 2022




***“Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord******God******, “that I will send a famine on the land,******not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.”*** -Amos 8:11

While more than 50% of Americans say the Bible holds the keys to a meaningful life, only about 16% open it more than a few days a week. Do these numbers surprise you? 

Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we’re traveling to Ohio, thanking God for the hunger He’s placing in the hearts of our fellow Bible Bus passengers like Nichole:

*“I am 34 years old. I surrendered my heart to Jesus Christ in 2019 and recently was baptized. In May 2021, I came across THRU the BIBLE while driving to work. I was immediately hooked and started listening every morning. My hunger for Dr. McGee’s teaching of the Word of God grows like wildfire because it is clear, easy to understand, and I love that he teaches about world history at the same time. My family and I have our Bible study group and I share with them the teachings of this wonderful program. Please accept my prayers and thanks to you and your team for doing such a tremendous work in continuing to get the whole Word to the whole world.”*

Today let’s thank God for the easy access we in North America have to the Bible and thank Him for the desire He places in our hearts to draw close to Him through it.

*Father, only Your Word can feed the deepest hunger of our souls. Help us to value it and want to know it better. Help us to persevere in diligently studying, even if only a few minutes a day. Teach us all You have for us and help us learn the truths that are critical for our lives and our relationship with You. As we grow in knowledge and our love for You, we pray Your light shines brightly in our lives so others will be drawn to You. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

**Are you ever surprised by the Bible? Miguel in Mexico is … hear his story tomorrow.**
