 Praying we are one with the Father


July 25, 2022




***“I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who******will believe in Me through their word;******that they all may be one, as******You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me.”*** -John 17:20-21

In our travels this month we’ve have seen and prayed for a lot of heartache and pain. As we begin our journey through North America this week, enjoy this lighthearted but meaningful email from Andrew in Jacksonville, Florida:

*“Dear friends,* *I felt it necessary to introduce the newest rider on the Bible Bus. While my daughter Shelley was only born two weeks ago, she has actually been listening to Dr. McGee every day while she was still in the womb. For my wife and I, she is our firstborn, and my mission as a father is to make sure she knows the Word of God and who Jesus is. The THRU the BIBLE ministry is the sharpest tool in my box to accomplish that.”*

Praise God for this little bundle of joy and all those who are joining the Bible Bus family this year. Thank Him for our fellow listeners—moms, dads, grandparents, aunts, uncles, neighbors, and friends—who are sharing God’s love with the children in their lives. Together let’s pray what Jesus prayed in John 17:20-21, that our children will see God’s glory, know the love of the Father, and be one with Him. Pray we all have eyes to see God’s glory and a heart and a life-long desire to draw close to Him through His Word.

**Tomorrow we’ll meet on our knees in Ohio.**
