 The remedy for a messy world


July 08, 2022




***The law of the******Lord******is perfect, converting the soul;******the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple; the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.*** -Psalm 19:7-8

We live in a messy world. So, what do we do when we’re scared or overwhelmed? A listener in Ethiopia encourages us to dig deep into God’s Word. Here’s his story:

*“I live in the northern part of the country where the situation is unstable. Your program brings me comfort. The Word of God is my hope, my protector, and my provider. Through it I am revived, made wise ,and my heart rejoices. When I am afraid, I praise God and worship Him. Please pray God will continue to strengthen me and I will remain faithful in my fear.”*

That’s great advice. Today as we pray for those in Ethiopia to be strengthened and uplifted by God’s Word heard on THRU the BIBLE, pray for all those who study the Bible with us. When we’re discouraged and afraid, may His timeless truth speak to our hearts, calm our minds, and fill us with the hope He offers to His beloved.

**Next week the Bible Bus is traveling through Acts and our team is praying through Central American and the Caribbean. Join us for both!**
