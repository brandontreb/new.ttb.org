 Does God hear our prayers?


July 15, 2022




***Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.*** -1 John 5:14

With one of the highest number of churches per square mile in the world, there’s no lack of spiritual resources in Jamaica. Even so, many of the nation’s professing Christians do not regularly attend church and fail to pursue lives of holiness. So today as we pray for this vibrant nation, thank God for faithful followers of His Word like Beverly.

*“**I live in Montego Bay, Jamaica, and will be 70 years old in December. I found you by accident as a new Christian in the 1970‘s and was a faithful listener every night until my shortwave radio went bad. For years I heard nothing until the advent of the internet. I searched for THRU the BIBLE and was so happy when I found it. By this time, Dr, McGee had gone home, but I was thankful that his work continues.*

*“I share it with my friends on Facebook and will sometimes post something that strikes me as particularly interesting. For example, in the intro to Leviticus there was a contrast between Exodus and Leviticus. I played it and stopped each time until I got it all down and then posted it.*

*“I listen as you share and remind us of how important our prayers are. I joined the World Prayer Team as part of my New Year’s resolution for 2021. I must tell you that it is the only one that I have kept in my entire life.*

*“Sometimes I wonder if God hears me pray. However, your message of encouragement is appreciated, and I will keep it up.”*

We thank God for prayer partners like Beverly and you, too. Keep praying for God’s Word heard in Jamaica and keep trusting in His promise that He is listening and answering.

**Are you sharing God’s Word with others? Join us on Monday and let Marija in Croatia inspire you.**
