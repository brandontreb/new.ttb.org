 Praying for senior citizens


July 21, 2022




Hop aboard and join us today as our prayer travels take us to São Marcos da Serra, an ancient settlement in Portugal.

There have been several discoveries of artifacts from the first and second centuries in this region, but today we find the real treasures are humble and heartwarming people like Marissa who shares:

*“I am lonely. Sometimes I care for my son who had a stroke, but most of the time it’s just me. I was from another church my entire life. My husband got to know Jesus through you, and I eventually did too. My husband passed away a few years ago, but I have stayed close to God and continued to go to church. They used to come and get me, but after the pandemic, they never came again. So, my fellowship is what I do with you. I can only thank you for being my church now. I’m 88 years old, but I’m still steady and working here in the field. Thank you for being my company.”*

Earlier in the month we prayed for isolated and lonely listeners in the Caribbean. Today let’s focus specifically on senior citizens like Marissa. 

*Father, thank You for all those who hop aboard the Bible Bus with us each day.* *Strengthen the minds and bodies of those who are advancing in years. Provide for their needs. Let them continue walking with You in grace and growing in wisdom. Help their neighbors, family, and communities to understand the importance of fellowship. Provide our senior sisters and brothers with a sense of purpose in Your kingdom through prayer, studying Your Word, and the opportunity to share their wisdom and love for You with a younger generation. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

**A listener in Serbia tells us, “When life doesn’t make sense … you can count on God.” Hear her story tomorrow.**
