 Pray for the isolated and lonely


July 11, 2022




***You will keep him in perfect peace,******whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You.***-Isaiah 26:3

The Bible is clear, we *will* go through seasons of hardship. But Isaiah 26:3 tells us that if we trust in God and keep our minds focused on Him, He will keep us in His peace. That’s also what we hear from Florestine who catches the Bible Bus from her home on the island of Nevis in the Caribbean Sea. Here’s what she tells us:

*“I used to attend Bible study, but because of health issues and other circumstances, I cannot attend my local church Bible study. However, THRU the BIBLE has been a great help to my spiritual life. Thank God for you who He uses to carry on the work. I am encouraged as I listen. Please keep up the good work of the Lord, keep on driving for Jesus—we all appreciate your efforts, they are not in vain.”*

Today as we thank God for His Word as it goes out in Central America and the Caribbean, let’s ask Him to use it to give peace to those like Florestine who are facing isolation and physical problems:

*Father, Your Word tells us we are better together, that it’s not good for us to be alone. You have made us with the desire for company and community. But there are those who are now more isolated than ever. We pray for the lonely, the isolated, and the vulnerable. Please be especially near to them. May they feel Your presence and know they are not alone. Put them on the hearts of Your people who can reach out to them in love. As they study Your Word with us, give them special grace to flourish in unexpected ways, so they can know you better and receive the peace You promise to those who keep their minds on You. In the name of Jesus we pray, amen.*

**Tomorrow we’re praying for faith to increase in Guatemala. Join us!**
