 Does God answer prayer?


December 06, 2022




***But certainly God has heard me;******He has attended to the voice of my prayer***. -Psalm 66:19

Does God really answer prayer? 

It’s a question we receive quite often at THRU the BIBLE and one we love to answer. 

Welcome, World Prayer Team. Our journey brings us to Malawi where on previous travels the shortage of trained pastors and church leaders has been on our hearts and in our prayers. So, be glad for this good word from a listener who hops aboard the Bible Bus in his language of Chichewa.

*“I wanted to say thank you to God for this program, it has helped me so much. I am also a teacher of the Word, but I am a young pastor, so I learn a lot from this program. I am so grateful for the teachings and the guidance that I get from the program. I share all that I hear with others. Please pray for me as I grow in God’s Word and in this ministry.”*

Does God answer prayer? Yes, He can. Yes, He does. This letter is proof. Let’s thank Him now:

*Father, we celebrate the many who are coming to faith as a result of hearing Your Word in Malawi. Thank You for hearing our prayers and answering them by stirring the hearts of this young pastor and others who have the desire to disciple Your people. Multiply their efforts, increase their numbers, and help them to bring glory to You in all that they do as they shepherd Your people. In the powerful name of Jesus, amen.* 

**We all need Jesus. Hear more tomorrow as we journey to Idaho and meet with a listener named Julie.**
