 Romans 5:8 made real


December 08, 2022




***But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.*** -Romans 5:8

If you hopped aboard the [Bible Bus](https://www.ttb.org/programs/the-5-year-study) today, you heard Gregg and Steve talk about the remarkable things God is doing through His Word in Nepal. Let’s continue the celebration with this letter from a listener named Sujan:

*“A year ago, I heard your program on Romans 5:8 and chose to believe in God. I’m continually surprised God chose a no good, unworthy, rather foolish sinner like me to be His son, but I accept that God loves me and His plan is wondrous for me. I have learned from you to have an abundant prayerful life and now I enjoy reading the Bible. Thank you for the programs you supply for my mobile device. I will continue to review them and share them with others.”*

What a great story. As we thank God for His Word that is changing lives in the predominately Hindu nation of Nepal, let’s also thank Him for the reminder that we too are unworthy and saved only by His grace. 

*Father, thank You for Jesus and our salvation through His sacrificial death on the cross. We really don’t understand a gift so lavish—but we receive it by faith. Use us, Lord, to tell others about Your unconditional love and to glorify Your name to all who will listen. In His matchless name we pray, amen.*

**God wants our attention. How did He get yours? A family in India shares their story tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
