 “Now I have ears to hear.”


December 01, 2022




***So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God***. -Romans 10:17  


The Bible talks a lot about hearing. Romans 10:17, Matthew 13:1-23, Isaiah 55:3, and Acts 7:51 come to mind. What other verses would you add? 

Willi in Ohio tells us there was a time when she listened to the Word of God and didn’t hear it, but thankfully things have changed: 

*“I am a backsliding sinner, and I trust Jesus. I love Him. I used to listen to Dr. McGee but fell by the wayside. My son who is in prison moved into the faith dormitory. I started reading the Word again so I could talk to him about it. I pray that he has handed everything over to Jesus.* 

*“Long ago when I did not know where to turn, I fell down before Him, telling Him I had no power of my own to fix things. He was faithful and opened doors for me. But how soon we forget and think we can do life on our own. Gratefully now I cannot get enough of the Bible via your podcast. Now I have ears to hear. I have learned so much. Thank you.”*

As our journey of prayer and praise continues, let’s thank God for the gift of hearing His Word today:

*Father, thank You for Your Spirit’s work in our lives so we can truly hear from You as we study Your Word. Grow our faith and help us apply what we learn. Give us the commitment and discipline to meet with You regularly and share Your Word with others, so they too can hear the Good News and come to faith in You. In the name of our precious Lord Jesus, amen.*

**Good stuff is happening with God’s Word in Angola. Celebrate with us tomorrow.**
