 From Morocco: “I’m growing fond of Jesus”


December 14, 2022




*“I’m growing fond of Jesus.”*

That’s what we hear from Samia in Morocco today as our countdown of praise continues on World Prayer Today. Here’s more of her story:

*“I’m an atheist from a Muslim background, but I started listening to your programs and the Bible is changing my life. I began listening after clicking on an internet ad that took me to a place that said I could find ‘the truth.’ I am surprised to hear your talk about salvation without anger or deeds. I promise to keep listening and will surely come back and be sending my questions so I understand more this magnificent being called Jesus.”*

As we pray for Samia’s salvation, praise God for His Word that is reaching people in Morocco and throughout the Arab world. As they listen may they too become more “fond of Jesus” and desire to know Him for who He really is.

**James 4:8 gets the attention of a listener in Uttar Pradesh, India. Hear his story tomorrow.**
