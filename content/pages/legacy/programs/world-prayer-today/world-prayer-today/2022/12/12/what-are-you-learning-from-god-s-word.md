 What are you learning from God’s Word?


December 12, 2022




***“If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king.”*** -Daniel 3:17

Today on the [Bible Bus](https://www.ttb.org/programs/the-5-year-study) Steve asked us to share what God is showing us in His Word as we study together. Here’s what a listener in Zimbabwe recently said: 

*“I heard your programs on Daniel and need to know more about how God saves us. Like* *Nebuchadnezzar, I am a prideful man. Your teachings have humbled me. Please tell me more about God and how I can have faith like Daniel.”*

Thank God His Word is heard in Zimbabwe and throughout Africa. Praise Him for the life of this listener and all those who study with us. Share your gratitude for His work in your life today, email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#07454e454b424552544753534529687560).

**Tomorrow we’re thanking God for His wisdom and timing. Join us in Albania.**
