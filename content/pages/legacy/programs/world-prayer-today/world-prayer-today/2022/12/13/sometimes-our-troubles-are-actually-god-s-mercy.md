 Sometimes our troubles are actually God’s mercy


December 13, 2022




***The end of a thing is better than its beginning;******the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.*** *-*Ecclesiastes 7:8

Over and over in the Bible we see that sometimes our troubles can actually be God’s mercy. That’s also what Barie in Albania realized when her life turned upside down. Here’s her story:

*“For many years I lived in the United States with my son. However, for many reasons I couldn’t stay and had to return home. I was angry and hostile for a few years, but after finding your programs and ultimately finding God, I see it so differently. I realize God brought me back to give me a fuller life. A life that focuses on Him. At first my husband would not let me listen to you, but as he saw my heart soften and my anger and complaining disappear, he allowed it. I even go to church and have a new family there. I am now praying for my husband and children to come to know the Lord. I am grateful for this new perspective and have learned a lot about waiting to see what God is doing in a situation before judging it. He really does know what’s best.”*

As our journey of praise continues, let’s pray using Ecclesiastes 7:8 as our guide.

*Father, we are shortsighted. Thank You for this reminder that we can trust You even when things in our lives don’t seem right or feel good. Help us develop patience in all situations so we can learn, watch, and wait for You to work. Give us Your strength to go on when all seems overwhelming and upsetting. Grow our trust in You and squelch our pride, so when difficulties arise in our lives, we can calmly surrender and look to You with gratitude, knowing You are working on our behalf. In the precious name of Jesus we pray, amen.*
