 Free and forgiven


December 27, 2022




*“For many in every generation, God has used this book of Romans to change thinking, deepen faith, and comfort hearts. It could be God will use this study in your life to teach, comfort, convict, encourage, or stir you towards a deeper faith in Him and greater effectiveness in living the Christian life.”* -Dr. J. Vernon McGee

If you’re traveling through Romans with us, you’ve heard Dr. McGee explain that when we study Romans we will

* Understand the basic facts about salvation,
* Be convicted about things related to our faith, and
* Find practical insight into Christian service.

Today as we praise our way through Côte d’Ivoire, we thank God for those who are joining us on the Bible Bus and in the family of God, like this one:

*“Your teaching has helped a lot to explain the Word of God. I do not read the Bible most of the time, and besides I find it difficult to understand it. But when you explain it, the messages are delivered as simply as possible and are very understandable to me. I have now been through several books with you, including Romans. I understood what repentance is, and today I am a son of God—free and forgiven of my sin. Thank you so much!”*

**The good news just keeps coming. Join us tomorrow as we travel to Egypt.**
