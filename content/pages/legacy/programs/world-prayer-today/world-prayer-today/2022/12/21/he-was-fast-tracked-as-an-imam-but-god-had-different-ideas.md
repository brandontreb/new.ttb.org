 He was fast tracked as an Imam, but God had different ideas


December 21, 2022




In many parts of the world, following Jesus is a crime punishable by law. In others, you can be disowned and abandoned by family. That’s the situation of a listener in Turkey. He writes:

*“I’m 29 years old and grew up in a conservative family. I was sent to Quran courses since my childhood; my family told me I was to become an Imam. Growing up I was beaten frequently and became very angry. A lot of our problems seemed to come from our religion.* 

*“At 20, I was married, and a few years later I became deeply depressed and started medication. During this time, I found your programs and listened regularly. My soul became lighter. One day I decided to pray the salvation prayer and become a Christian. No one including my wife knows about it. I feel freedom in my heart for the first time, but I don’t know how or when to speak with my family about it. They still believe I will be a great man for Allah. Please pray for me.”*

Thank God today for this young man and all those who have found eternal life through His Word this year. Pray for those who must worship Him in secret. Ask His Spirit to strengthen them and encourage them when they feel alone, and give them discernment, courage, and boldness to share their faith when the time is right.

**God is overcoming hurdles to faith in Egypt. Hear more tomorrow.**
