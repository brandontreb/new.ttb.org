 Becoming wise for salvation


December 05, 2022




***But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.******All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.*** -2 Timothy 3:14-17

*“Why do you read the Bible over and over?”*

That’s the question a listener of THRU the BIBLE in Ethiopia was recently asked by a relative. Here’s his story.

*“I have been a regular listener for many years! I have read fully the Bible stories several times repeatedly. Some of my family thinks I’m crazy because of how much I read and study. But when I read the Bible again and again, it is always new to me. When I was young the Lord used the Holy Spirit to teach me very simple things from the Bible. As I get older the Spirit takes me deeper. The whole Bible story talks about salvation. Like it says in 2 Timothy 3, the Scriptures make us wiser, we know more about God and our salvation, we become equipped to live for Him. I thank God for His Word and you for your teachings.”*

What a great response! Let’s thank God today, too:

*Heavenly Father, thank You for loving us so much that You sent the Lord Jesus to die for us and to pay the price for our sins. Thank You that in Your Word, we find the wisdom and strength to live our lives as You intended. Thank You for Your Spirit who continues to help us see new things. Please give us the character and the courage to put what we’re learning to practical use so we can glorify You in a lost world. In Jesus’ magnificent name we pray, amen.*

**The party of praise continues tomorrow in Malawi. Come along and join us on the prayer journey.**
