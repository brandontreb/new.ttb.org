 Muslims are hearing the gospel, and the response is surprising


December 20, 2022




1.8 billion Muslims don’t know Jesus. For many, the obstacles to believing in Him are numerous and the cost is high. But God is bigger than all this, and His Word is changing minds and hearts. Rejoice in this recent text from a listener in Africa:

*“The Bible says there is salvation in none other than Jesus. As a Muslim, I always thought Jesus was just another prophet. Can you tell me more? I am intrigued.”*

A glorious day is ahead when people from every nation and tribe will stand before God crying loudly, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb” (Revelation 7:10). Until then, we’ll keep praying and praising Him.
