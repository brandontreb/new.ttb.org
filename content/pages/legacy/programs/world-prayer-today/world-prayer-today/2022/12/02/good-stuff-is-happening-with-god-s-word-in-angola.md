 Good stuff is happening with God’s Word in Angola


December 02, 2022




***“If you******ask anything in My name, I will do it.”***-John 14:14

Welcome, World Prayer Team. We’re back in Angola today with exciting news.

A bit of background: In previous journeys together we’ve learned that biblically-trained pastors in Angola are few and that God’s Word is often mixed with other spiritually dark practices. More than once we’ve prayed together for God’s truth to prevail and for His Word to clear up misconceptions and multiplicity of beliefs. 

Update: *God is answering our prayers.* Check out this report from an Umbundu listener of THRU the BIBLE in Angola. 

*“I started listening to your program and was amazed at how easy it was to follow and understand the teaching. The Bible started making sense. I still had a lot of questions, so I went to a Christian friend to ask. He was impressed at the depth of my questions and wondered where I was getting my knowledge. When I mentioned your program, he told me there is a church that has been founded through your study.* *I couldn’t believe it! I decided to visit myself and see it with my own eyes. There is no pastor, but we listen to the studies and talk through them together. What a relief to know there are others who seek the truth as well. Please pray for us.”*

Today thank God for this congregation in Africa and all those who gather together on the Bible Bus. Ask Him to multiply their numbers and encourage their hearts as together they seek Him in His Word.

**“Why do you read the Bible over and over?” Have you ever received that question from a family member or friend? A listener in Ethiopia shares his gracious answer next time on World Prayer Today.**
