 We’re flinging the seed


December 16, 2022




Did you hop aboard the Bible Bus today and hear Gregg and Steve talk about following in Dr. McGee’s footsteps by “flinging the seed” of God’s Word to His world? If you didn’t, [catch it here](https://www.ttb.org/programs/the-5-year-study). You’ll really enjoy the conversation.

One of the places THRU the BIBLE is “flinging out the seed” is in Kazakhstan, and we’re excited to share how God is using it for His glory. Listen to this story from a listener named Omar:

*“I am the only one with Wi-Fi in my village, so people come to my house to use the internet. I often turn the volume of my radio receiver on full and play your radio programs in the Kazakh language. No one wants to leave because the internet is available. They stay and listen. Some of them yell at me to stop the radio, and I let them know they are free to leave. Nevertheless, they stay for the internet. Some linger after and ask questions about God, Jesus, and salvation. Please pray for them.”*

Isn’t that great? Omar is a partner in flinging out the seed with us. As THRU the BIBLE goes out today in more than 200 languages, we thank God for listeners like Omar and all of you who pray, financially support, and share this ministry with others. Together, let’s ask the Lord to bear much fruit from our efforts and praise Him for results we will only see when one day we gather with Him and the church in heaven. 

**We’ve got more good news about God’s faithfulness. We’ll see you on Monday in Madhya Pradesh, India.**
