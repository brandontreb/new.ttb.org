 When the end is really the beginning


August 11, 2022




We are saved by the grace of God. We don’t earn it. We don’t have to work for it. We receive it. That’s what we hear on the Bible Bus today as it rolls along in our study of Acts. And that’s exactly what we’re praising God for today as we meet with a listener in Cameroon. Here’s his story:

*“I have done so many terrible things to myself, to my family, and to others. After I had driven everyone in my life away and I lost my business, I felt so much shame. I thought I had nothing left, that I was at the end and there was nowhere to go. But it turns out it was only the beginning. I met a man who took pity on me. He took me to see a pastor who told me about God’s love and forgiveness. I told about the bad things I had done and thought he would condemn me. But he said God offers me a new life. There and then I accepted the truth. He told me I need to read the Bible and that you would help. I thank Jesus for saving me and you for helping me know Him better.”*

Thank God He uses our weaknesses for His glory. Do you know someone struggling with the weight of their sin or previous hurts or injustices? Share Dr. McGee’s free digital booklet, [“Forget About It: How to Put the Past Behind You,”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_forget-about-it.pdf?sfvrsn=d91a1e16_2) with them today.

**Your prayers are needed tomorrow. Come along as we pray our way through the Democratic Republic of Congo.**
