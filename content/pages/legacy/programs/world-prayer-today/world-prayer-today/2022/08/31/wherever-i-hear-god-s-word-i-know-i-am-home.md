 “Wherever I hear God’s Word, I know I am home.”


August 31, 2022




***“Therefore******whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock.”*** -Matthew 7:24

*“**Wherever I hear God’s Word, I know I am home.”*

That’s what we hear from Alvarro in Colombia as we continue our prayer trek through South America. Here’s more of his story:

*“I travel a lot for my job. Mostly between Colombia and Spain, but I often find myself in other parts of the world as well. For many years I was very lonely. I wanted to be a part of a church, to join a Bible study, but I was never in one place for very long. Then I came across your program. I honestly don’t remember how. What I do remember is that once I began listening, I haven’t stopped. Now no matter where I am, when I listen to God’s Word I know I am at home with Him. Your consistent voice and His enduring Word are all I need to be at peace.”*

Thank God for His Word that is our foundation we can build our lives upon. Pray more people in Colombia join us on the Bible Bus and learn to build their lives on the immoveable rock of Jesus Christ.

**Pray with us tomorrow through Paraguay. It won’t be the same without you.**
