 Praying for warriors of the Word in Myanmar


August 02, 2022




***But you, O Lord, are a shield for me, my glory and the One who lifts up my head. I cried to the Lord with my voice, and He heard me from His holy hill. I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord sustained me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.*** -Psalm 3:3-6

Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today as we pray our way through the political and spiritual battlefield that is Myanmar, praise God for listeners like this one who join us on the Bible Bus: 

*“I am a pastor in a village I will not name because it is not safe. I thank you for giving me a radio and thank God that I have the opportunity to hear His Word. Your teaching helps me know how and what to teach on Sunday morning. When I can, I also recommend that church members listen to you during the week. We consider ourselves warriors of God’s Word. Some people wish to discourage us, but we continue on. The physical needs of my people are great; please pray God’s love is real to them.”*

What a great request. Let’s pray using Psalm 3:3-6 as our guide:

*Father, we thank You that You are shield for Your people. Please lift the heads of our brothers and sisters in Myanmar. Help them to know You are with them, sustaining them, protecting them, keeping them from harm. Help them to surrender their fears and worries to You and walk confidently in Your Word. In the precious name of Jesus we pray, amen.*

**Good things are happening in Vietnam because of God’s Word. Hear more tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
