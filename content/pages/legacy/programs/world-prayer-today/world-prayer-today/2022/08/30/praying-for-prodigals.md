 Praying for prodigals


August 30, 2022




***If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.*** -1 John 1:9

*“Through your teaching, I accepted Christ at only 13 years old. My family disagreed, but with your teaching I was able to move ahead. I listened in the mornings at 6:30 AM while I was getting ready to go to school.* 

*“More than ten years have passed; today I am 26. I walked away from my faith and wasted many years in sin. During the pandemic, I became nostalgic and remembered how often I listened as a child.* 

*“While the pandemic was tragic for many, for me it has served me for the better. Being home alone made me remember how much I yearned to learn from the Word of God, and I returned to being like that 13-year-old girl who knew by heart the introduction of the program, the music, the letters, and the ending. I thank God your teaching is still available and that He is willing to forgive me.”*

Pray for all those in Ecuador who have walked away from God. Like Sara, ask Him to use His Word to bring them home to Himself. Then praise Him for His redeeming love. Thank Him that when we confess our sin, He faithfully forgives us of them all—-the big, the small, the ugly, the indecent—and lovingly welcomes us back into His open arms.

**A world traveler finally finds himself at home in God’s Word. Hear more tomorrow as we pray together in Colombia.**
