 Don’t give up


August 08, 2022




***“Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great andmighty things, which you do not know.”*** -*Jeremiah 33:3*

Today on the Bible Bus we saw that resistance to the gospel was so big in Corinth, Paul was ready to give up and go elsewhere. That’s when God intervened and told him to stay put. 

Are you facing great difficulties today? Are people not responding to you as you think they should? Are circumstances so difficult you’re ready to walk away? You aren’t alone. Here’s what we hear from Salvador in Equatorial Guinea.

*“I am 18 years old, and I was discouraged with life. My parents are divorced, and I live with my grandparents. I prayed God would change things, that my parents would return to me, but they didn’t. I began to consider suicide. At my lowest point I found your programs on Psalms. I could really relate to them. The more I listened, the less I felt alone. I began to pray and now find myself feeling hopeful about the future. I start each morning praying and looking to God for the answers I need. I’m so glad I listened and didn’t give up.”*

God is faithful! As we pray today, let’s start with Jeremiah 33:3 and ask God to give us a glimpse of the great things He has in store for us in His will.

*Father, thank You that when we are at our darkest points, You are never far. We pray for our brothers and sisters who are struggling today. As they call upon You, please wrap them in Your arms and show them the plans You have for them in Christ. Be their guide. Be their comforter. Draw them near and give them a sense of Your greater purpose so they may never give up. In Jesus’ name amen.*

**Muslims in Chad are listening and learning alongside us on the Bible Bus. Find out more tomorrow.**
