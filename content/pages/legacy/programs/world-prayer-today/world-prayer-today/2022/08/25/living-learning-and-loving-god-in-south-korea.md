 Living, learning and loving God in South Korea


August 25, 2022




***All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.*** -2 Timothy 3:16 

*“I greet you with gratitude for all you have taught me.”*

That’s the warm welcome we receive from a listener named Joon as we touch down in South Korea today. He continues:

*“I am always learning new things when I study the Bible with you. It gives me a chance to take a good hard look at myself and decide if I like what I see. Today’s study on repentance was so good. Thank you for helping me grow in my faith. As we learn from His Word, I enjoy living life and loving God alongside you.”*

What an encouragement. Today let’s pray more people in South Korea and across the globe benefit as we study God’s Word together. We’ll use 2 Timothy 3:16 as our guide.

*Thank You, Father, for Your inspired Word. Teach us, convict us, correct us, and train us through Your truth. As we study the Bible together, equip us to carry out the work You have for us to do. Keep us mindful of the battles that face the Church around the world, and help us to live and work for Your praise and glory. In Jesus' name, amen.*

**We’re praying for big changes in Taiwan tomorrow. Join us.**
