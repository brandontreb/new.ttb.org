 Praying for those preyed upon in Angola


August 10, 2022




In our previous prayer travels through Angola, we’ve seen that God’s Word is often mixed with other spiritual practices, and it can be hard for Angolans to find truth. Today we hear a similar story:

*“I live in a region where there are many groups calling themselves churches, but they just preach the gospel for their pocket. The gospel you teach is different. Church leaders here are taking from us the small money that we make for our needs. But since we listen to THRU the BIBLE our lives are being changed! Now we know much better the Word of God and do not accept these erroneous messages anymore! I praise God for you because it took us from darkness to spiritual life. Now my joy is complete.”*

Poverty is widespread in Angola. Many people live on less than $1 a day. As God’s Word goes out in the language of Umbundu, pray that the truth of His Word weeds out deceptive teachings and shines a light on those who prey upon innocent people through dark and deceitful practices. May knowing God and understanding the Bible bring freedom from falsehoods to all those who listen.

**We have a new brother in Cameroon. Celebrate with us tomorrow.**
