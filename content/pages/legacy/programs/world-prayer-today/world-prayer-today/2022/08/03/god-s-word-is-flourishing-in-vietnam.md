 God’s Word is flourishing in Vietnam


August 03, 2022




***“For My thoughts are not your thoughts,******nor are your ways My ways,” says the******Lord. “******For as the heavens are higher than the earth,******so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.”*** -Isaiah 55:8-9 

Do our prayers matter? As the Bible Bus rolls through Acts this month, we’ll see how God used a prayer meeting held by a group of women to change the whole direction of the first-century church. And as the World Prayer Team travels on our knees through southeastern Asia, we meet with Hao who tells us how God is responding to our intercessions in Vietnam: 

*“I am a young pastor in a rural area. My church is growing and is now up to 100 members. Many walk a good distance to be with us. Your programs are helpful for many Christians because they can hear the Word every day and share it with their neighbors. I don’t have much training, so I am learning alongside them. We enjoy meeting together and discussing all that God is revealing. I know this is a result of your prayers. Please continue, because God’s Word is flourishing in unexpected places.”*

Today thank God that His ways and thoughts are higher than ours. Ask Him to continue to use THRU the BIBLE to reach more people in Vietnam and grow His church in unexpected and wonderful places. 

**Join us tomorrow as we praise God and pray for His people in Timor Leste.**
