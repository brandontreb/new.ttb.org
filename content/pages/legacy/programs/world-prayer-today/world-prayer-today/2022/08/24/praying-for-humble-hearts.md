 Praying for humble hearts


August 24, 2022




***But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.*** *-*Romans 8:11

As we pray for God’s Word going out in eastern Asia this week, we have the privilege of stopping to chat with Guoliang in China. He shares:

*“I first began listening to you last year. In each study of each person, I saw myself. Pride, selfishness, hypocrisy, disobedience … I have them all. It was humbling and humiliating. I almost gave up, but as God dealt with me, He also gave me a desire to become a new and different person. His Spirit encouraged me that with help I could be faithful, sincere, compassionate, and kind. I still possess some bad qualities that God dislikes and am needing Him to change me over and over. May God grant me power to overcome fleshly desires so I can live a victorious life. Thankful for teachings of truth and prompting of the Holy Spirit, I will constantly renew and change all my life.”*

What a great reminder, let’s ask God to help us do the same.

*Father, thank You for the new beginnings You provide in every moment. We praise You for the love, mercy, grace, and forgiveness You continually show us. Thank You that even when we fail, You are there waiting to pick us up and guide us back on the path. As we study Your Word together, may Your Spirit help us live victoriously and give us humble hearts that want to please you each day. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

**Get ready for a warm welcome as we travel on our knees through South Korea tomorrow. A listener named Joon is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.**
