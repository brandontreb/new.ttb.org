 Pray for underground home groups in Iran


May 19, 2022




More than 100 million people worldwide speak Persian, and very few have likely ever seen a Bible in their own language.

Welcome to Iran. Today as we pray for God’s Word as it goes out on the radio and satellite TV, let’s also pray for brothers and sisters like Mina who lead underground THRU the BIBLE home groups:

*“Your programs are a great resource for us. Understanding God’s Word is precious. Please pray for us as we study. All we are learning is foreign to us, but the truth is slowly becoming known to us.”*

**Pray with confidence! God is hearing our prayers and answering them. See you tomorrow in Israel.**
