 Good things come to those who study the Bible!


May 13, 2022




**Thus says the****Lord****, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: “I am the****Lord****your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way you should go. Oh, that you had heeded My commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.”** -Isaiah 48:17-18

What have you learned on the Bible Bus? Aravind in Andhra Pradesh shares his answer:

*“Good things come to those who study the Bible! Thank you for telling me about the righteousness of God and how I can become righteous, too. This knowledge has changed my life. I have done many bad things to people I love and want to change my ways. Please pray for me. I am the only believer in my family, and you have become my steadfast friend and mentor. I know the Holy Spirit is using God’s Word to make me a better person, in addition to showing me the way to eternal life.”*

As we study God’s Word, pray that the Holy Spirit fills us all with the wisdom and discernment we need to live holy lives. May the peace and righteousness He promises in Isaiah 48:17-18 be ours when we follow Him.

**What are you learning as we travel together through God’s Word? May is Letter Month and we’d love to hear from you.
