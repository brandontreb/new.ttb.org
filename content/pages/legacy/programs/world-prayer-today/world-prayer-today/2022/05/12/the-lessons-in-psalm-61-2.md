 The lessons in Psalm 61:2


May 12, 2022




***From the end of the earth I will cry to You, when my heart is overwhelmed;*** ***l******ead me to the rock that is higher than I.*** -Psalm 61:2

*“I’m 24, and I really need Jesus in my life right now. I have a father who is in jail, and I am struggling with lots of things right now. This is one of the hardest times of my life, I just need Jesus and your prayers. I feel like I am worthless to everyone and that no one wants me in this world.”*

That’s the difficult letter we recently received from Nepal. Pray today for this young listener and all those who need to be reminded of God’s great love and care. While you’re on your knees, also thank Him that, like David in the Psalms, we can pour our hearts out to Him and trust He will lead us to a saving knowledge and faith in Jesus Christ. Do you know Him today? Praise Him! Do you need Him today? Praise Him!
