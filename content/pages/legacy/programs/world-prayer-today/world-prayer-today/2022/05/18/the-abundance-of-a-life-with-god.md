 The abundance of a life with God


May 18, 2022




***I will open rivers in desolate heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. I will plant in the wilderness the cedar and the acacia tree, the myrtle and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the cypress tree and the pine and the box tree together, that they may see and know, and consider and understand together, that the hand of the******Lord******has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.*** -Isaiah 41:18-20

*“The more I study with you, the more my eyes are opened to the unity of the Bible, its truthfulness, and its revelation through its prophecies that had a previous and future fulfillment. The God of the Bible is the Holy One and worthy of our praise.”*

That’s the great news we hear from one listener of Kol ElKetab, THRU the BIBLE’s satellite TV program in Arabic. 

Today thank God that His Word is heard in the spiritual desert of the Middle East. Pray specifically for those who hear it. May new life spring from the desert floor, blossoming in a life lived with God. 

**More than 100 million speak Persian. Join us tomorrow as we pray for God’s Word to reach them.**
