 A listener in Romania discovers the truth of Isaiah 40:8


May 24, 2022




***The grass withers, the flower fades,******but the word of our God stands forever.*** -Isaiah 40:8

God’s Word has answers. The more we study the Bible, the more we find out how relevant it is. That’s what Stela from Romania tells us. Here’s what she recently wrote to tell us:

*“I have learned much from these studies. Pastor McGee’s comments are very insightful. I remember sometimes I have prayed for specific decisions in my life and God answered me through His Word. I was shocked to find such an old book had so much meaning in my daily life. My Bible is my most valued possession. My life is better for the principles I have learned. I pray the lives of others will be, too.”*

As you thank God for the timelessness of His Word and the benefits it provides in Stela’s life and yours, ask Him to reach others in Romania, so they too discover the treasure that awaits them when they hop aboard the Bible Bus and study with us.

**An unexpected ministry gives a listener in Hungary an opportunity to see God provide. Hear his story tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
