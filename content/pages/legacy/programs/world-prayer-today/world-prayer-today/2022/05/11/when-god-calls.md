 When God calls


May 11, 2022




***“Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you.”*** -Jeremiah 31:3

*“I worshiped the suns, the moons, the stars, and all kinds of animals. I was also an alcoholic. But surprisingly none of this kept God from finding me. A friend shared you program with me, and I broke down in a good way. Jesus called me, and I have never looked back. I am now an active member of the church and live my life for Him, my Savior.”*

That’s what we hear from a listener in Tripura, India. Together let’s pray that more people in Tripura and around the world realize God loves them and is drawing them to new life in Jesus Christ. 

*Father, as Your Word goes out in the language of Kok Borok today, let all those who hear it be receptive. When Your Spirit speaks to their hearts, help them realize what they put their trust in will fail them and that only Jesus Christ will save them. Help them respond in faith to Your offer to forgive their sins and cleanse them with the blood of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who wants to save them today. Amen.*

**A young listener in Nepal cries out to the Lord. Pray with us tomorrow.**
