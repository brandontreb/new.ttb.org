 Born to wander, praying to wonder


May 20, 2022




***With my whole heart I have sought You;*** ***oh, let me not wander from Your commandments! Your word I have hidden in my heart,******that I might not sin against You.*** -Psalm 119:10-11

Today in our study of Deuteronomy, Dr. McGee reviewed Israel’s past and we discovered their wandering hearts aren’t much different than ours today. Today as we travel on our knees, we meet with Aabid who understands the struggle of staying connected with God and asks us to pray with him.

*“I don’t have a home. I travel all over the Middle East for my job and am grateful I’ve found your Arabic programs so easily available. Please pray for me. Never being in one place very long brings a lot of temptations. I need God’s Word to remind me what is important and to keep my priorities aligned with His.”*

What a great request. Let’s use Psalm 119:10-11 as our guide as we pray for all those who study God’s Word with us.

*Lord, we give You our whole hearts. Our desire is to please You in everything we do. Let Your Word take up residence in our hearts. May your Spirit convict and enable us to live by faith. Help us not to wander, but to live in the power of Your Spirit each day. In Jesus’ precious name we pray, amen.*

**There is so much more to pray about. Join us on Monday in Belarus.**
