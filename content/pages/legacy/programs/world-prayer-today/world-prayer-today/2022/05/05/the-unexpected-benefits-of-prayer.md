 The unexpected benefits of prayer


May 05, 2022




**“Being alone with God and communing with Him is the strength of the Christian’s life.”** –A. C. Gaebelein 

*“It’s clear that God is opening doors for His Word in the world, but I’m also getting so much from this group, which I didn’t expect.”*

That’s what we hear from a World Prayer Team member named Marlies. Here’s more of her story:

*“I recently joined the team and am moved each time I read the letters. I was on the Bible Bus about three years a while ago and have started again recently. I feel such peace coming back to his pure teachings.* *May God bless you.”*

Are you surprised at how God is shaping you as you pray for His Word in the lives of others? How is He strengthening you? We’d love to celebrate with you. Email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#490b000b050c0b1c1a091d1d0b67263b2e).
