 The universal language of God’s love


May 04, 2022




***… Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints.*** -Ephesians 6:18

Welcome, World Prayer Team, today we’re in New York visiting with a fellow World Prayer Team member named Bonnie. Here’s her story:

*“My spiritual family keeps growing exponentially. While reading my World Prayer Team email, I also listen briefly to the native tongue broadcast for that country. I can understand why so many people from other countries are drawn to these broadcasts. I enjoy listening to the speaker and, although I have no clue what he is saying, I know we are all hearing the universal language of God’s love through these broadcasts.*

*“The recent events in Ukraine have made me more aware of the need to hold up your program translators and producers around the world in earnest prayer. Most Christians in the U.S. and Canada pray for their local church pastors, but when I listened to Vitalyi Kozubovsky give the daily McGee lesson in the Ukrainian language it brought tears to my eyes. I was humbled because of the sincere love of Christ I heard in his voice, and I was somewhat ashamed because these dear translators do so much to spread God’s Word, and I felt I was doing so little with my modest monthly donation to THRU The BIBLE. However, through my tears the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart and said, ‘Pray, Bonnie, JUST PRAY!’*

*“I wiped my tears, blew my nose, and thought … I can’t speak any language other than English, I’m too old to be a missionary in a foreign land, I’m not wealthy and can only afford to send a modest monthly donation … but there is something VERY IMPORTANT that I can do. As it says in Ephesians 6:18, I CAN PRAY! And I will.* *What a beautiful family I belong to!”*

God is at work in lives around the world and in your life, too. Celebrate that today, friends. Tell others about Him and tell us all the great things He has done and is doing for you. Glorify Him in your heart and encourage others by emailing us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#400209020c05021513001414026e2f3227).

**The unexpected benefits of prayer. That’s what we hear about tomorrow from another team member. Join us on World Prayer Today.**
