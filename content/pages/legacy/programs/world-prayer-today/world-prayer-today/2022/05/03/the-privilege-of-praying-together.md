 The privilege of praying together


May 03, 2022




***And they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the Lord: “For He is good, for His mercy endures forever toward Israel. Then all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.”*** -Ezra 3:11

We’re rejoicing in the privilege of prayer and the way God uses His Word in our lives this week. Today a fellow passenger named Pat shares this:

*“I think I began getting the World Prayer Team emails maybe a year or so ago. After I listen to THRU the BIBLE on the app, I open my laptop and go through my emails. The first one I look for is yours. I’ve learned so much about the people who have found God and are now part of the family. I love reading their stories and praying for their specific requests. I feel like I actually ‘know’ some of them. I’m so happy you send these emails—they bring the whole world to me, and by getting the emails in the morning, I can think and pray about them all day. I can’t wait to see where we’re going next and where we can shout with praise at what the Lord is doing.”*

Yes! We’ve got some great destinations and some great people to “meet.” There’s a lot to pray about, so stay with us and be sure to share what God is doing in your life as we travel together. Send your note to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f7d767d737a7d6a6c7f6b6b7d11504d58). Together let’s shout about God’s goodness and praise Him for the strong foundation of His Word. 

**“Pray, just pray.” That’s what we hear tomorrow from a fellow World Prayer Team member in New York. Hop aboard and be encouraged.**
