 A prayer for Saudi Arabia


May 16, 2022




The epicenter and birthplace of Islam, Saudi Arabia holds influence over Muslims worldwide and touches many cultures. Billions of oil dollars go towards promotion of Islam around the world every year. Many say a spiritual breakthrough for Jesus Christ here would transform Islam and all who follow it. 

Today as we pray for God’s Word heard on THRU the BIBLE as it goes out in Arabic, pray Muslims will embrace Jesus as the only way they can ever truly know and be reconciled to God. Let’s do it now:

*Father, only You can convict of sin, change hearts, and open eyes to recognize Jesus as Lord and Savior, Your Son, risen from the dead.*

*Let the Saudi people hear your Word today. Soften their minds to Your truth; make it burn in their hearts. As they meet Jesus, bring them to repentance and forgiveness of their sins.*

*Father, draw millions to Yourself from the clutches of Islam today. We pray with confidence because we know You can do far greater than all we can ask or imagine. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

**Courageously following Jesus despite the cost, pray for our brothers and sisters in Oman tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
