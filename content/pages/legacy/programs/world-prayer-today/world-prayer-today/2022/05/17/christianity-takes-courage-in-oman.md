 Christianity takes courage in Oman


May 17, 2022




Compared to its neighbors, Oman enjoys a relatively open and modern society. All residents may practice their faith, and the government gave land to build places of worship. But Christiansâ€™ lives may vary greatly depending on their status and nationality. 

Omani nationals who convert from Islam to Christianity encounter the highest levels of pressure from both their families and their surrounding society. Omani believers may be kicked out of their family homes and lose their jobs. They can lose custody of their children and be stripped of their inheritance.

Today, pray for the few Omanis who bravely follow Him despite the cost. Ask God to give them peace and courage as they endure hardship and strengthen their faith through these trials. 

**Our journey through the Middle East continues tomorrow. Join as we pray our way through Kuwait.**
