 Good news in Bangladesh


September 05, 2022




***W******hoever calls on the name of the******Lord******shall be saved****.* -Acts 2:21

Almost 90 percent of Bangladeshis are Muslims, that’s why THRU the BIBLE’s team was surprised (and overwhelmed) to receive this great report from a local home group leader:

*"Nine people accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior as a result of this program. They were recently baptized. I thank the Lord for this opportunity to reach out in the name of Jesus, and I believe that He is doing wonderful things.”*

What great news! Today as we thank God for these new brothers and sisters, also thank Him for all those getting His Word out in Bangladesh. Praise Him for home group leaders like this one and THRU the BIBLE’S team that recruits, trains, and follows up with them. As you do, we’ll be giving thanks for you, too. Your faithful prayers are making such a difference!

**Ready for more good news? Meet us tomorrow in West Bengal.**
