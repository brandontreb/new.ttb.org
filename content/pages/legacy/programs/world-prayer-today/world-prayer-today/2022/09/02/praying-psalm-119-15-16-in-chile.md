 Praying Psalm 119:15-16 in Chile


September 02, 2022




***I will meditate on Your precepts, and contemplate Your ways.******I will delight myself in Your statutes; I will not forget Your word.*** -Psalm 119:15-16

Welcome, prayer travelers! Today we’re in Chile—a long, narrow country spanning nearly 2,800 miles from north to south on the southwestern coast of South America.

Chile’s population is a melting pot, including speakers of Mapuche, Basque, Andalusian, Spanish, German, English, Swiss, and Italian. Today let’s pray Psalm 119:15-16 for God’s Word as it goes out to the people of Chile on THRU the BIBLE in Spanish. May it reach the hearts of more Chileans like this one:

*“God bless you, all of you who in one way or another labor in the work of our God. May God continue to support you with the power of the Holy Spirit. At this moment I am studying the Psalms, and I have already studied other books, and all of them have been of great blessing. Thank you for helping me not to forget God’s Word.”*

**We’ve got good news out of Bangladesh on Monday. Join us for the journey.**
