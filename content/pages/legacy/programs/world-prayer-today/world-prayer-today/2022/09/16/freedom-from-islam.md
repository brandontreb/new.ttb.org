 Freedom from Islam


September 16, 2022




***“Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.”*** -John 8:36

*“I am free from Islam.”* 

That’s the amazing news we hear from a listener on the Bible Bus as we travel through Turkey today. Here’s more of his story:

*“I am 23 years old and was raised in a family that were devout followers of Islam. We had many rules, restrictions, and punishments. I want to live free and don’t want to think about what people say about me. I hated the hypocrisy growing up. A lot of my relatives do what is forbidden to them in secret. The most important thing for them is how they look from the outside. After searching other religions, I found your program and understood that Jesus is who I was searching for. He helped me to overcome my anger and gave me freedom in my heart. Please pray for my family.”*

Knowing Jesus *is* to have life . Today thank God we are free to know Him, to be forgiven by Him, reconciled to God, and on our way to an eternity with Him. Praise Him for our freedom from our sin and freedom from the endless cycle of trying to earn His acceptance and love. Pray more young people in Turkey find the freedom God offers us through His Son, Jesus. May they too enjoy the privilege of being called His son or daughter.

**Next week our journey through eastern Europe begins in Russia. Rest up! We’ll see you there.**
