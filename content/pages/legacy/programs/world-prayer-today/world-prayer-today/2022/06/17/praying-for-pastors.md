 Praying for pastors


June 17, 2022




Jesus, Mary, Isaiah, Timothy, Jeremiah—the Bible is filled with wonderful examples of young people God called to give Him their lives and who did tremendous things for His kingdom. And He’s still doing it today. Rejoice in this letter from Gonzalo, a young man in Texas who says:

*“I started listening to THRU the BIBLE at the age of 8. I am now 23. I feel as though I have received the gift of a great education. I now feel as though I am able to attend Bible school and become a pastor. Please pray for me.”*

As we thank God for all those on the Bible Bus uniquely called to lead His church, here are a few ways we can specifically pray for them entering the ministry:

* Pray for their personal relationship with the Lord. May they love God with all their heart, mind, soul, and strength and spend time with Him alone each day.
* Pray for pastors as they share the Word. Ask God’s Spirit to move within them, giving them boldness and clarity as they speak. Ultimately, pray God is glorified through them.
* Pray they are protected from every enemy. Thank Him in confidence for protecting them in every way—spiritually, physically, mentally, emotionally.

**Will God still accept me? That’s the question a listener in Austria asks on Monday. Join us as we pray.**
