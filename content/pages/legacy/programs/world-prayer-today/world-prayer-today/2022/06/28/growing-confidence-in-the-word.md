 Growing confidence in the Word


June 28, 2022




***And in that day you will say, “Praise the Lord, call upon His name; declare His deeds among the peoples, make mention that His name is exalted.”*** -Isaiah 12:4

One of the many benefits of regular Bible study is the confidence it gives us to share the goodness of God with others. 

A listener of THRU the BIBLE’s Shona program in Botswana has found great purpose in sharing his faith. He tells us:

*“I enjoy listening every day. l value this wonderful time, as it continuously brings me closer to my God. Through your teachings l have seen myself growing spiritually, so that l can now share the Word of God with friends, community, and relatives. I am normally a reserved personality, so initially this was difficult. However, the more I know about God, the more I can no longer be silent. I find myself talking about Him in all situations, and people actually listen. This has* *brought my heart great joy and given me a new reason for living. May the Lord continue to use us for His glory.”*

Today as we pray for more people to hear THRU the BIBLE in the Shona language, also ask God to give each of us a desire to be more purposeful in sharing the Good News with others. As we study His Word together, may our confidence grow and our hearts overfill with a joy we can’t keep to ourselves.

**Philippians 1:21 has new meaning for a listener in Eswatini. Find out more tomorrow.**
