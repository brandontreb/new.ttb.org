 What happens when we hide God’s Word in our hearts?


June 30, 2022




***Your word I have hidden in my heart,******that I might not sin against You.Blessed are You, O Lord! Teach me Your statutes.With my lips I have declared all the judgments of Your mouth.I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies, as much as in all riches. I will meditate on Your precepts, and contemplate Your ways.I will delight myself in Your statutes; I will not forget Your word.*** -Psalm 119:11-16

When you invest in studying God’s Word, the rewards are far greater than you can ever imagine. That’s what we hear from a listener in South Africa. He shares:

*“I travel often between the U.K. and South Africa and find your program is the only church I can attend. Each lesson is thoughtfully prepared, and I am surprised at how much I am actually learning. I have often prayed with you asking God to hide His Word in my heart … and I find that He has answered these prayers. Just when I need it, I recall a certain verse or particular teaching. I know this must be the Holy Spirit bringing what we have studied to mind. This encourages me to learn more so that in every situation I face I may rely on God’s Word.”*

Today let’s pray Psalm 119:11-16 and thank God for the valuable lessons we are learning together on the Bible Bus and for the prompts His Spirit gives us when we need them most. 

*Father, thank You for Your Word that is relevant and a road map for our everyday lives. Help us to study it, memorize it, and love it. Reveal the meaning of each verse to us so that we can understand them and live by them. Give us the opportunity to apply the Bible to our lives and communicate to all those we meet how good You truly are. Above all else,  help us to hide Your Word in our hearts, so that we will not sin against You. In the name of Jesus we pray, amen.*

**God’s Word is needed in Lesotho. Pray with us as it goes out tomorrow.**
