 What to do with our worries


June 03, 2022




*“We need hope tomorrow will be brighter. We need hope that at the end of this journey there is satisfaction and fullness of life. We get it, friend, it’s available in God’s Word.”* -Dr J. Vernon McGee

Are you feeling crushed by your circumstances? A listener in Niger can relate. Here’s his story:

*“Discouragements almost swallowed me up. I had staggering piles of unsettled debts steadily confronting me. I was angry, exhausted, and beginning to lose the will to go on. That’s when I heard your teachings in my language of Igbo. I started receiving fresh directions from the Lord on how to hold up my head above the raging storms. I learned to hang on, to give my problems to God, and let Him work out the details. It is not as easy as it sounds, but is possible and does make a difference.”*

As we thank God for this gentleman and all those who join us on the Bible Bus in their language of Igbo, let’s pray 1 Peter 5:7 for those among us who are struggling:

*Heavenly Father, thank You for Your deep care and concern for each of us. We’re grateful for Your promise to carry our burdens. When we’re worried or afraid, remind us You are completely trustworthy and that hope can be found in Your Word. Help us not to let worry control our lives, but instead give You the control and freedom to work in the way You see fit. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

***Our prayer trek continues on Monday. Join us in Finland.***
