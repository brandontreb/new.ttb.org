 Bowing down before Him


June 07, 2022




***All the ends of the earth******shall remember and turn to the Lord,******and all the families of the nations shall worship before You.*** -Psalm 22:27

THRU the BIBLE has been heard in Norway since 1983. While we don’t get many responses from this region, we know God is using His Word as He intends. As we travel together, let’s bow before Him and pray for Aage Nevland and all those who faithfully keep the Bible Bus running in the Norwegian language. May God bless their efforts and more Norwegians hear His name and call Him Savior and Lord.

*Father, You are the King of all nations. We are grateful for Your presence in our lives and pray more will bow down before You today. We pray for our team working tirelessly to make You known throughout Norway. Send Your Spirit before them to prepare hearts and minds to receive the grace and mercy You so generously have offered us through Your Son, Jesus. It’s in His name we pray, amen.*

**Your prayers are needed tomorrow in Sweden. Hop aboard and join us.**
