 Where ancient meets modern


June 09, 2022




***The earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness,******the world and those who dwell therein.*** -Psalm 24:1

In the far north of Norway, a unique mix of old traditions and modern technology live side by side in the community of people known as Sami.We’ve learned on previous prayer journeys that while some of the Sami still cling to their animist traditions, many consider themselves Lutheran, but few are committed to following Jesus.

Together let’s pray for THRU the BIBLE as it reaches these unique and wonderful people. We’ll start with praying Psalm 24:1.

*Lord, the whole earth is Yours, and everything in it! The world and all its people belong to You—including the Sami.* *As THRU the BIBLE goes out in the language of Lapp, *may every man, woman, and child of Sami heritage hear about and understand the depth of Your love for them.* As they do, may they turn to You in faith and believe Jesus Christ died for them so they can be forgiven from their sin. In the precious name of Jesus we pray, amen.* 

**Did you know nearly 200,000 Syrians live in Sweden? Pray for them tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
