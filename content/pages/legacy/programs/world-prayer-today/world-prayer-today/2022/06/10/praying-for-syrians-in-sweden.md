 Praying for Syrians in Sweden


June 10, 2022




In contrast to its neighboring countries, Swedish immigration policies were less strict up until recent years, and many refugees found their way to Sweden in the wake of the Syrian Civil War in 2015. As a result, Syrians constitute the largest foreign-born group in Sweden. 

Today as we pray for THRU the BIBLE as it goes out in the language of Arabic (in Sweden and around the world), pray more people like Modar hear it and respond.

*“After immigrating, I began to listen to your programs. It was like hearing a voice from home. I would like to share that I have come to know Jesus and I’m learning a lot from you. It is so different from what I have been raised and taught, but I believe that Jesus is Lord!”*

What great proof God is answering our prayers! 

**Grab some flip flops and a hat—on Monday we’ll meet up in sunny California, USA.**
