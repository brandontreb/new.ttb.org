 A bold prayer for the United Kingdom


June 21, 2022




Ian in England has some encouragement for us today. Here’s his story:

*“I am an 85-year-old follower of Christ here in Oakham, England. I have just read the World Prayer email and tears have formed in my eyes as I realize that I have brothers and sisters all over the world, separated physically by distance but all one in Jesus Christ.* 

*“I rejoice in all these lovely letters showing how effective is God’s Word in bringing us all together in one body in Him. Praise God and thank you for giving us the blessing that sharing these letters provides. May God’s Word give us courage to reach out in His name so more will reap the blessing of eternal life with Him.”*

Ian’s right—there is nothing more important. Let’s pray for that now.

*Heavenly Father, please embolden Your people in the United Kingdom and all over the world. Give them wisdom in discerning Scripture, help them to feed on Your Word, breathing it in daily so they are prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks the reason for the hope they have. Give Christians in the U.K. courage to share and prepare the hearts of many to hear of Your grace through their testimonies. In the name of Jesus we pray, amen.*

**A listener in France is “missing something.” Find out what it is tomorrow as we pray together.**
