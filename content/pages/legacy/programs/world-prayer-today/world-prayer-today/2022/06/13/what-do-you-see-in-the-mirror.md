 What do you see in the mirror?


June 13, 2022




***Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.*** -2 Corinthians 3:17-18

As Christians, the more control we give God’s Spirit over our lives, the more He grows us and shapes us to be more like Jesus. If you held up a mirror today, what would you see? Miriam in California tells us what she’s praying to see:

*“I listen in Spanish and am so grateful for your excellent program. It helps me understand the Word more and to know God more. The more I learn, the more I hope to be like Jesus. To imitate Him, to look like Him, to give Him praise in all I do. Please pray that my reflection will express His joy, His patience, and His love every day.”*

Today pray this for Miriam and all our brothers and sisters on the Bible Bus. As we study God’s Word together, may we become increasingly more like Him each day.

**God’s Word has gotten a listener named Ted through some tough times. Find out more and pray with us tomorrow as our journey through North America continues.**
