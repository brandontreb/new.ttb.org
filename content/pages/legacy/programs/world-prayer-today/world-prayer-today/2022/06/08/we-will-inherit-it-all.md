 We will inherit it all


June 08, 2022




***Blessed is the nation whose God is the******Lord******,******the people He has chosen as His own inheritance.*** -Psalm 33:12

The nation of Sweden is in serious spiritual decline. As we know from previous travels, most Swedes (especially youth) are increasingly liberal and believe that church and God are not relevant to daily life.

As we pray today, ask God to bring Sweden back to her spiritual roots so His church may once again shine brightly in a secular world.

*Lord, You are God of the heavens and Father of all nations. We thank You for grace and mercy when we stray. We ask You to bring renewal and revival to the country of Sweden. Give their leaders (political, social, and cultural) reverence and respect for You so that the people may follow. When You look on them may You soon see a people whose hearts are turned toward You. A people chosen to inherit all the blessings Your Word promises. Speak to their hearts and change their lives. In the name of Jesus, amen.*

**Tomorrow we’ll pray for God’s Word as it goes out in the language of Lapp. It’s going to be a great journey.**
