 Freedom from fear


June 14, 2022




***Remember the word to Your servant,******upon which You have caused me to hope. This is my comfort in my affliction, for Your word has given me life.***-Psalm 119:49-50

As we travel THRU the BIBLE together, we’re finding God’s Word gives us peace in the most unsettling and scary of circumstances. It brings comfort when we are worried, tired, and struggling to get through the day. That’s the story we recently heard from a fellow listener named Ted. He shares:

*“I am sitting next to my son, Cameron, who is in the intensive care trauma unit after a horrible motorcycle accident. He collided with a semi-truck in bad weather. No one here understands how he is alive, with almost everything broken, including neck, back, chest, arms, and a brain bleed. The neurologist told me yesterday there is nothing from his imaging that indicates any type of paralysis or permanent issues after he has some relatively minor neck surgery.*

*“I have been at his side praying the entire time, as are many others, and I’m so thankful for what God is doing. I’m struggling greatly today, feeling very much responsible for not keeping him safe. Anytime I feel stressed by the world or under attack, I turn to Dr. McGee’s teaching for comfort from God’s Word. Today is one of those days. Thank you for continuing his ministry.”*

As you pray for Ted and Cameron today, pray for all those on the Bible Bus who are feeling weary and afraid. May the hope and life God offers us in His Word be their reality today, freeing them from fear as they trust Him.

**Hope is in the air. Join us tomorrow in Quebec, Canada.**
