## 
 God’s faithful are growing in Arkansas


June 16, 2022




Our prayers
are being answered here at home and around the world. Listen to this great
story from Linda, a fellow passenger on the Bible Bus from Mountain Home,
Arkansas. She shares:

*“Thank you for
being a big influence to me becoming closer to Jesus. This Easter Sunday I was
baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It was a very
powerful night for me. I am 67 years old, and I have never been more alive.*

*“Thank you
for your part in educating me ever since I stepped on the Bible Bus back in
2018. You are and you continue to be a big part of my faith education.”*

God is adding
to His faithful every day! Thank Him today and ask that more people join us on
the Bible Bus and then take the step of publicly declaring their belief and
commitment to Him. 

**Join us in
Texas next time.**
