 God never gives up on us


October 20, 2022




*“God’s timing is always perfect.”* 

That’s what we hear from a listener named Monica in the United States today. She continues: 

*“I listened to a study in Judges today, and Dr. McGee spoke about the way history repeats itself and the fact that our gracious God still uses ordinary sinners to do His work. I am reminded that His timing is always perfect, and that my many trials over the years—some brought on by my own disobedience and some from outside circumstances—are all used for the same purpose by my loving Savior: To bring me into a more intimate relationship with Him. I can now say I wouldn't change a thing because of the real treasure I have found along the arduous journey.*

*“Although times and seasons may change, man's nature does not. Yet what a comfort to know we have such a loving Father who also never changes in His redemptive work and generosity in mercy and grace upon us when we give our whole hearts to His Son, Jesus.*

*“Thank you for keeping the Word going to all the world, and as a prayer partner with this ministry, I will continue my part in praying for these loaves and fish to keep going out to the hungry hearts.”* 

God never gives up on us. Isn’t that a great reason to keep going—no matter what we face? Today ask God to remind us that His ultimate goal is a relationship with us and He will use everything in our lives to draw us closer to Him. Like Monica, may we too see the blessing even the detours and bumpy roads lead us back to Him.
