 An open invitation


October 03, 2022




Gathering around God’s Word is always a good idea. That’s what we hear from Maggie in the Dominican Republic. She shares:

*“For many years my husband and I have hosted a weekly dinner for friends after we study the Bible together. Your programs help us understand each book and then we have great discussion. Over time our group has grown. Just like God’s offer of salvation, ours is an open invitation to anyone who wants to join us. Thank you for giving us the tools to reach out with God’s Word.”*

Today thank God for His open invitation to a relationship with Him, and pray more people in the Dominican Republic hear and accept it. While you’re at it, ask Him to use you in new ways to invite those you know and love into God’s Word, too.

**Worship with us tomorrow as we continue to travel through** **Central America and the Caribbean.**
