 Why worship?


October 04, 2022




***Enter into His gates with thanksgiving,******and into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name. For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting, and His truth endures to all generations.*** -Psalm 100:4-5

God’s Word tells us we were made to worship Him. It’s our way of connecting with Him and focusing on His purpose and plan for our lives. John, who catches the Bible Bus in Spanish, tells how learning to worship God has changed his life:

*“I was separated for a long time from the Lord. One day, I heard your program, and you motivated me. Thanks to your ministry, I was inspired. I went back to church, and now I have learned to worship. The simple practice of celebrating God’s presence and power in my life has changed me. I am no longer anxious or worried about small matters, and my anger is now under control. Thank you for your teaching; each message is a beautiful song that fills my heart.”*

Today come before the Lord with Psalm 100 in mind. Thank God and praise Him for His goodness, His mercy, and His truth that has endured through the ages. As His Word goes out, ask Him for more people in Central America and the Caribbean to join us as we study His Word and learn what it means to worship Him with their lives.
