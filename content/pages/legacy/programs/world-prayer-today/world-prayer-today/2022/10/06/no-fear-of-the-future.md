 No fear of the future


October 06, 2022




***For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.*** -Romans 8:18

Everyone experiences hard times, but as believers, God’s Word offers us hope for the future. In eternity with the Lord, we will find only peace and joy. That’s the good news Mica in Panama shares with us today:

*“For years I have been studying the passages of the Bible thanks to you. In harrowing moments, it always gives me encouragement because I am reminded there is something much deeper involved in our routine lives. God is at work preparing us for a day when we won’t have to worry or fear. Please pray my unsaved family members and friends will come to know the Lord and realize they can trust Him with the future.”*

Thank God for His promise in Romans 8:18 that our struggles are nothing in light of the tomorrow He has prepared for us. Join Mica in praying more people in Panama come to know Jesus so they too can experience joy and confidence in the knowledge of a future with Him.

**Grab your fins and snorkel. Tomorrow we’re headed to the gorgeous waters of Belize.**
