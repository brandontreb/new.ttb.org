 A faith that sticks


October 12, 2022




What does it mean to have a faith that sticks? A listener in India tells us his story:

*“I became a Christian a few years ago, but it didn’t stick. One day a neighbor invited me to his home to hear a message. It was on the lost son. While listening, I came to understand that I am a precious child of God. I wanted to go back to the Father, who was waiting for me. My life is now completely changed. I study the Word with these neighbors regularly and have become quite dedicated to living a faithful life.* *I’m stepping into a new season of faith and with the help of my group I know this time it will stick for a lifetime.”*

What a great report. Today pray for Home Groups like this one across India. Ask God to bless their leaders, to multiply their numbers, and through the study of His Word may more people develop a faith that “sticks” with them.

**A small gesture leads to eternal impact. Join us tomorrow in West Bengal for another great story.**
