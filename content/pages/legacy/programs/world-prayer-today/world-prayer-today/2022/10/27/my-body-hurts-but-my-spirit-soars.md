 “My body hurts, but my spirit soars”


October 27, 2022




*“My body hurts, but my spirit soars.”* That’s what we hear from a listener in Czechia today. She continues:

*“I am seriously ill and my eyesight is bad. I have very limited motor skills. Your radio program is very important to me. With each teaching I am inspired to know God more and trust Him with my situation. I need to be reminded frequently of His grace. A friend comes each day to listen with me. Together we are transported from my bedroom to another time and place that is lighter and more joyful than my daily existence. Thank you for this.”*

Thank God that He is with us in every situation. Together let’s pray for those on the Bible Bus who are physically struggling.

*“Father, thank You for Your Spirit who is always with us and comforts us. Although we don’t understand why illness comes into our lives, we do know that You walk every path with us. Remind those among us who are struggling that You are walking with them right now. Remind them that You love them, no matter what they are going through. Thank You that You never leave us, that You never forsake us, and that we can trust in You with our lives. As we study Your Word, please strengthen our bodies and our minds. In the precious name of Jesus we pray, amen.”*

**Stop worrying, start praying. That’s the advice we hear tomorrow in Germany.**
