 Praying Psalm 119 in Papua New Guinea


March 31, 2022




***Your word******is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.*** –Psalm 119:105

What would life be like if you couldn’t read or write? That’s the reality for a surprising number of people in Papua New Guinea today. It’s also likely a contributing factor to one of the biggest challenges facing the church in this region: The failure of God’s people to engage with Scripture.  

Today as we travel through this amazingly beautiful and ethnically diverse country, use Psalm 119 as your guide in praying for two specific things: 

1. For more people to hear God’s Word on THRU the BIBLE—especially those who cannot read it.
2. For every Papuan child to have access to an education that includes reading and writing so they can read God’s Word, understand it, and so future generations will experience the joy of engaging with God’s Word on their own.
