 Praying for the spiritual battle in Gabon


March 24, 2022




On our previous prayer travels through Gabon, we’ve learned that although it’s a politically peaceful country, there is a spiritual battle going on. That’s why we’re especially grateful to hear from this listener who hops aboard the Bible Bus every day. He says:

*“Your teachings are very helpful. The truth can be hard to find, and false teaching is tricky. I was especially interested in your teaching about the weapon of prayer in Ephesians 6. I am committed to this now more than ever. I pray for your programs, and I pray for each one of you. I especially pray that your teaching helps drive out those who spread lies in the name of our Lord.”*

What a great prayer. Let’s join him. 

*Father, thank You that in Your Word we can find truth. May deception have no influence in Your church in Gabon. May deceivers be cast out from positions of authority and set free from their wrong thinking and wrongdoing. We pray Jesus remains the focus of all that is taught about You. In His precious name, amen.*

**What’s the greatest challenge facing the church today? Find out tomorrow as our prayer journey through Africa continues.**
