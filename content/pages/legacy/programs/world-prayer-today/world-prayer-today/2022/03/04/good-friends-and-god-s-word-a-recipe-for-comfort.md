 Good friends and God’s Word: A recipe for comfort


March 04, 2022




***Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing.*** –1 Thessalonians 5:11

*“Good friends and God’s Word. What more does a girl need?”* That’s what we hear from Laura in Arizona. Here’s more of her story:

*“I want to thank you for your programs. My husband is a pastor, and we faithfully served in Christian ministry until God made it clear it was time to move on. It was painful, but we clung to family and trusted the Lord. A few months later, our college–age daughter left us to live in relationship with another woman. It was then I felt that the ground under my feet was slipping. Somedays when I didn’t feel like getting out of bed, my close girlfriends came over. We prayed together and read Scripture. We laughed and we cried. Then one suggested we listen to Dr. McGee. Several years later we are still meeting, encouraging one another to press on no matter what comes our way. Before all this I knew God’s Word back and forth, but spending time with these ladies and Dr. McGee in God’s Word was a perfect recipe for comfort and healing.”* 

Praise God for good friends who carry us in prayer and faith when we are unable to do it alone. Thank Him for the people in your life who encourage you to spend more time seeking Him in His Word. Pray today for all those on the Bible Bus who feel isolated and alone in their faith. Ask God to bring them just one person to encourage and edify them as they walk by faith.

**There’s lots to pray about in Southeastern Asia. We’ll meet you in Indonesia on Monday.**
