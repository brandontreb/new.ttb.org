 Praising God for His promise in Psalm 145:18


March 15, 2022




***The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth.*** –Psalm 145:18  
Want to pray for those watching THRU the BIBLE on Turkish satellite TV or hearing it on the radio? Let’s use this quick list of their most frequently asked questions to guide us:

1. Did the Bible change?
2. How can I become a Christian?
3. What is the afterlife for a Christian?
4. Is there a heaven and hell?
5. Who is Jesus?

Aren’t these great? Today pray for those hearing God’s Word in Turkish. Ask God to prepare their hearts and thank Him for His promise found in Psalm 145:18. While we’re at it, let’s pray for the faithful team who answer questions like these. May God give them discernment as they share His love and His truth with all who ask.
