 What word is used more than 100 times in the Gospel of John?


March 02, 2022




***But these*** [things]***are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.*** –John 20:31

It’s a great day on the Bible Bus as we begin our study of the Gospel of John, and it’s also a great day to be on the World Prayer Team as we travel on our knees through North America.

The Gospel of John was written that we might “believe”—that word is used over 100 times in the book of John. So today, let’s praise God for listeners like this one who are making the decision to believe in Jesus Christ through the study of His Word and pray more will join him on the Bible Bus:

*“I am Armand from Canada. I listen online in Spanish. I found you about a year ago and believed in Jesus Christ. Since then, I have been growing in the Word and telling others about your program. Thank you for giving me the tools I need to move forward in my faith.”*

Have a friend you want to invite into the joy of studying John? Have them download a copy of our new [Bible Companion for John](/docs/default-source/booklets/ttb_john-bible-companion.pdf?sfvrsn=81181816_4). In addition to readable summaries of our studies on the Bible Bus, each lesson contains prompts to Dr. McGee’s audio messages and direct links to the passages in God’s Word. 

And if you know someone who’d like to join us on the Bible Bus in a language other than English, tell them about our new app—[find it here](/programs/broadcasts-podcasts) or in your favorite app store. There’s always room on the Bible Bus for one more.

**Mexico is our destination tomorrow. Hop aboard and pray with us.**
