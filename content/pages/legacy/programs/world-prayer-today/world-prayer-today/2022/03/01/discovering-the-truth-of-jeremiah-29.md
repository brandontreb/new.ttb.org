 Discovering the truth of Jeremiah 29


March 01, 2022




***Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.*** –Jeremiah 29:12-13

Today on the Bible Bus we completed our journey through the Old Testament book of Numbers. As Dr. McGee pointed out, God recorded the wandering of the Israelites to show He was still with them. And that’s what we’re praying today—for everyone who hops aboard with us in North America to know God is near, even when we don’t see Him, especially those who join us in French like this one: 

*“I never tire of listening to these teachings. I always discover what I need to enlarge my spiritual life and my faith. Each lesson applies to me directly. I used to feel as though God was distant, but as I’m in His Word it’s as if He Himself is with me, teaching me.”*

What a great reminder for all of us. Let’s seek Him, draw near, and rest in the knowledge that He listens. 

**We’ve got a new brother in Canada. Meet him tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
