 “I'm not sure how to face my family with my new faith …”


March 14, 2022




***That you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, for all patience and longsuffering with joy.*** –Colossians 1:10-11 

*“‘The Bible is corrupt. Christians believe in three gods. Christianity is only in the western countries.’ I heard these comments so often growing up, I wondered why my parents were fighting so hard against Christianity instead of just focusing on our religion.”*

That’s the beginning of an email we recently received from Sofian in Egypt. Here’s the rest:

*“That’s when I started watching some videos online and reading posts from Christians on social media. Some of them talked about your programs. I began to watch. Immediately I found Jesus’ teachings were different and fascinating. Now I’m a regular and thrilled to let you know I want to declare Jesus is my Lord. I want Him to take all of my sins and set me free. Pray for me, because I am not sure how to face my family with my new faith.”*

Leaving Islam to follow Jesus can be a tough and costly decision. Today let’s pray Colossians 1:10-11 for Sofian and all those who find Jesus by watching Kol el Ketab, THRU the BIBLE on Arabic satellite TV. As they walk with the Lord, may He strengthen them, protect them, and give them joy in serving Him even when it’s hard.
