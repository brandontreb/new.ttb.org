 Exchanging my weakness for His strength


February 27, 2018




Today our world prayer journey brings us to the stunning country of Ecuador, where we meet with a listener named Jorge who shares:


*“I have great faith in God, for He saved me from the filth in which I lived. I was lost in drugs and alcohol, but I could hear His call and I responded to Him. Because of Him I am saved.* Thru the Bible *has been a great help at the time when I needed it the most. Every day I learn more about God and gain strength from His Word. Thank you for the materials you’ve sent me. I have used them in the Lord's work as I give my testimony to other addicts.”*


What a great testimony! Today let’s pray for all those who listen to *Thru the Bible* in Spanish. Like Jorge, let’s pray that God’s Word gives them the strength to use their weakness for His glory! 


And as we continue our travels through Ecuador, let’s also remember to pray for *Thru the Bible’s* broadcasts in the Quichua language that reach roughly 3 million indigenous people.


**Thanks for your prayer and partnership. Join us tomorrow as we travel to the Caribbean.**
