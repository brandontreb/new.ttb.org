 “Thank you for the precious gift of God’s Word!”


February 13, 2018




*“I was picking olives in the field and took a break. That’s when God got my attention through* *your program. I have been listening ever since, and my heart has been transformed*.”


That’s the good news that we hear from a listener named Dinos as we travel through the breathtaking landscape of Greece here on World Prayer Today.


As we stop in Thessalonica, we can just picture a young woman greeting us with this good news, 


*“My three girlfriends and I listen to your programs every day. We wanted to know more about Jesus and you gave us Bibles. Thank you for the precious gift of God’s Word!”*


Isn’t this good news? Let’s ask today that many others in Greece and around the world will be stirred by the name of Jesus Christ. Pray that God will grow their faith in Him so they can share the good news with others around them.


**Tomorrow we stop in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Join us and invite a friend along for the journey.**
