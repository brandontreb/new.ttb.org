 Praying for teachers of the Word in the Caribbean


February 28, 2018




Welcome to World Prayer Today! Despite the lush beauty that surrounds us here in the Caribbean Islands, the hearts of God’s people are sure to be the most beautiful thing we’ll see on our journey today.


In Puerto Rico, we meet a wife and mother who tells us,


*“I’ve been riding the Bible Bus with you for more than ten years now, and I have learned plenty about the Word of God. Little by little, I can honestly say that my Lord has been transforming me; I notice it in my way of thinking and reasoning. It’s amazing. I share what I’ve learned with my family and friends and pray regularly for their salvation.”*


 And this Sunday school teacher from St. John’s, Antigua, shares, 


*“I am so thankful to the Lord that although Dr. McGee is in heaven, I can still travel on the Bible Bus each morning. I am an assistant Sunday school teacher, and I must say that I’ve used the information to help me out with my lessons.”*


Today, let’s praise God for those who faithfully study God’s Word and share it with others. And, let’s ask Him to continue to bless the teaching of His Word in the Caribbean so that more people will hear of Jesus and believe.


**Join us tomorrow as we pray with faithful listeners in Argentina.**
