 Praying for struggling churches in Quebec


February 01, 2018




As we land in the Canadian province of Quebec today, we are met by *Thru the Bible*’s French producer, Rejean Joly, who asks us to pray that God’s Word will reach more people in northeastern Canada and bring a sense a of unity and growth among the struggling churches.


According to Rejean, church attendance in Quebec is lower than anywhere else in Canada, and collaboration across denominational lines is rapidly declining. 


Let’s pray now.


*Father, we intercede today for Your church in Canada, particularly in Quebec. We thank You for leaders like Rejean and pastors who are standing for You in this spiritually needy area. We pray that through the broadcasting of Your Word, You will bring more people into a real and eternal relationship with Your Son, Jesus Christ. And we ask that Your example of grace and mercy will guide all believers to unity for Your glory. In the name of Jesus we pray, amen.*


**Join us tomorrow as we pray for listeners in the southwest, right here in the U.S.**
