 Discover the promise of Psalm 62


February 12, 2018




God’s Word tells us that, *“*[The Lord] *only**is**my rock and my salvation; he is**my defence; I shall not be moved.”*


Welcome to World Prayer Today as we travel to Albania and meet with Ilda, a young woman who clings to these words in Psalm 62:6. She says,


*“I am a 19-year-old Roma girl. I grew up in a very poor family. When I was a child, I heard about Jesus and I was eager to know more about him. In our community, the girls marry very young. I was married at 15 years old. I have had many difficulties in my life and Jesus has been my rock and my salvation. I heard about your radio program from my mother. I listen to TTB every day. Thank you for helping me understand the Bible more and to walk in God's promises despite my present circumstances.”*


Isn’t that encouraging? Let’s praise God for the maturity of young Christians like Ilda. Let’s ask God to help more of us to trust Jesus when life feels difficult. 


**Tomorrow we’re off to the gorgeous country of Greece. We’ll meet you right here.**
