 “I worry that I will return to my wicked ways…”


February 16, 2018




In Psalm 3:3, 4 God’s Word tells us: 


*“But You, O Lord, are a shield for me,  

My glory and the One who lifts up my head.  

I cried to the Lord with my voice,  

And He heard me from His holy hill.”*


We’re glad you’ve joined our world prayer trek today as we travel to Poland and meet with a young woman who shares why this passage of Scripture is so important to her. 


*“I was a difficult child and caused lots of problems for my parents and teachers. I became addicted to drugs and recently had to go through the drying out treatment. It turned out that my therapist was a Christian. She helped me towards the Lord Jesus and I became a believer. My great adventure with Jesus began at that point. Not long ago I was baptized here in prison and I listen to your program every day. Thank you for helping me to follow Jesus. I worry that when I am released I will return to my wicked ways, but I rest in the knowledge that God will lift my head and shield me, if I ask.”*


Today let’s pray that God leads and protects this young woman and all those who want to follow Him but find it impossible on their own. Ask the Father to place people in their lives to help them continue to follow God’s Word.


**Join us next week as we meet some fascinating people as we pray our way through Southeast Asia, here on World Prayer Today.**
