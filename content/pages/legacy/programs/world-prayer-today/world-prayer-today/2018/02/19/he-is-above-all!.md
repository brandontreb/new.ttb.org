 “He is above all!”


February 19, 2018




What does studying the Word of God do to your faith? A faithful Cambodian listener of *Thru the Bible’s* Khmer program tells us, 


*“Listening to your program for many years, my faith changed from weak to strong. Moreover, the Word of God made me know Jesus more and more. I thank the great God who taught me and changed me to become His Son for making this possible. Thank you! But I must add that as I listened, so did my family. And they too have become children of God. Isn’t God wonderful? He is above all, and He can do everything. Thank you!”*


No greater testimony could be said than that. Let’s praise God together with this listener and family. Pray for more in the country of Cambodia to come to a saving faith in Jesus Christ. 


**Tomorrow, we’ll continue to pray across Southeast Asia.**
