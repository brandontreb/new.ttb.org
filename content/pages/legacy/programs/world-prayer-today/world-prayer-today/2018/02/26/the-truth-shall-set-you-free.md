 The truth shall set you free …


February 26, 2018




John 8:32 says, *“And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”*


And that’s exactly what we are praying today as we travel to the gorgeous country of Belize where more than 85 percent of the people say they are Christian, but many still participate in the superstitions, black magic, or paganism of their ancestors.


Together let’s ask that the truth heard on *Thru the Bible’s* Spanish broadcasts will open the hearts of the people and free them from the darkness of their traditions. 


And while we’re on our knees, let’s also lift up the faithful pastors in Belize who receive very little formal training and tirelessly work at multiple jobs to provide for the physical needs of their families and the spiritual needs of their congregations. 


**Tomorrow we’re off to Ecuador … we’ll see you then.**
