 Pray for the message in Myanmar


February 20, 2018




The gospel is relatively new to Myanmar. For generations, Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) was closed to outside influences. Now, as they slowly emerge, many are hearing the name of Jesus for the first time. 


Like this Burmese woman:


***“****When I heard biblical messages presented by your program, they were new and strange to me. Sometimes I listen while I prepare tea for visitors. Not only can I hear but now my visitors can, too, and they are benefited by spiritual strength. Your program is very precious for me. When I was asked to share at church, I told them the messages I heard from you.”*


Pray today for young believers, that God will continue to draw the spiritually hungry to Himself in Myanmar.


**Tomorrow we travel “down under.”**
