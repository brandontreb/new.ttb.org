 Praising God in the midst of difficulty


December 25, 2018




When the angels declared “good tidings of great joy which will be to all people” as they announced Jesus’ birth in that Bethlehem field, they modeled how God’s grace would be shared with people from every country on earth. 


The people of Zimbabwe especially need our prayers. Unemployment is nearly 90%, the AIDS crisis is still desperate, and the education system faces insurmountable challenges. 


But God’s Word is flourishing in people’s hearts in Zimbabwe like never before. Trusted researchers tell us that although the country seems to be disintegrating around them, believers have increased in numbers and passion.


As one listener of *Thru the Bible’s* broadcast in the Shona language tells us:


*“I am happy to let you know that your word keeps me living my daily life with guidance and encouragement. I am HIV positive and have been for a long time. It was through your word that I realized that God loves me and can still talk to me despite my condition. Your teachings made me humble enough that even my husband stays with me, though he is not HIV positive. Again thank you for helping me realize that through Jesus, God finds me worthy of His love.”*


And another listener writes:


*“When times are bleak, your teachings of truth have been my source of strength in the Lord. I managed to turn from my wicked ways and I desire to trust in the Lord only. Even though my life is difficult, I want to praise God with everything I have.”*


Isn’t that amazing? Let’s praise God for the faith of these listeners and all those facing crisis in Zimbabwe. Let’s also pray today that, like them, we will trust and praise God even when life is hard. 


**Tomorrow we’re off to Armenia … hop aboard and join us.**
