 From drugs to dependence on Jesus


December 13, 2018




John 16:33 says, *“These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”* 


Welcome to World Prayer Today. As our journey of praise and celebration continues this month, we stop and visit with a listener in Chhattisgarh, India, who shares: 


*“I came to know the true and living God through your program. I come from a different faith and I used to worship many gods and goddesses. I led a sinful life. I had many bad habits and I had no hope in my life. Without drugs I was unable to survive. I consumed alcohol every day.* 


*In short, I was totally under the devil’s control. Until one day when I was tuning my radio, a beautiful song attracted me to your Chhattisgarhi radio program. I liked both the songs and teachings and so started listening to the program daily.* 


*“Your message touched my heart and I came to know the truth. I came to know the consequences of taking drugs. I then began to correspond with your office and spoke to them on the phone many times. And when I started listening to the Word of God regularly, I was blessed and felt God’s power in my life. Then I started to believe in Jesus Christ and I stopped idol worship. I read the Word of God daily. His Word speaks to me. I then repented for my sins and accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior.*  *“I now listen to your program regularly and encourage others to listen. After accepting Christ, God has brought peace and joy into my life. His mighty hand is upon me, He blesses me, leads me, and guides me daily.* 


*“I thank the Lord Jesus Christ for overcoming the world, for wiping away all my tears and turning my sorrows into joy. He has given me a peace I never thought possible. In my village no one believes in Jesus except for me. Please pray that many people may come to the Lord through my testimony and through your program.”*


What an encouraging report! Let’s praise God for the work He is doing in India and around the world. Let’s also keep praying that more listeners of our Chhattisgarhi broadcast hear God’s Word and respond in faith! 


**The celebration continues tomorrow … join us here on World Prayer Today.**
