 Celebrating the faithful in India


December 10, 2018




God’s Word is changing lives in India! 


That’s what our World Prayer Team is celebrating today. Listen to this good news:


*“We are several listeners of your program and we listen every day, morning and evening. We do not have a church, but thanks to this teaching we are blessed because our lives are restored, and resolutions to our problems are found. We praise God for your faithful work and ask that you keep broadcasting so that we may keep learning.”*


Today, let’s praise God for the faith of these brothers and sisters! And let’s ask Him that we, too, will find restoration and resolutions to our problems as we study His Word. 


**There’s a lot more to celebrate this week! Invite a friend to join our World Prayer Team here at [TTB.org/pray](http://www.TTB.org/pray).**
