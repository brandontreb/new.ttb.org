## 
 Be encouraged by a future heavenly scene


December 27, 2018




Whew! In 2018, we traveled on our knees around the world, country to country. Thank you for your fellowship and faithfulness on the journey! 


As we reflect on our worldwide prayer journey, consider the following questions: 


* What country or story do you remember praying for this year? Any stand out?
* How did God use this prayer journey in your life? Do you see the world any differently?
* Why would you like to continue and encourage others to join you?


Think about how you would answer and share your responses with your fellow World Prayer Team. Just send your comments and encouragement to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dd9f949f91989f888e9d89899ff3b2afba) and we’ll get the word out.  


As we end our journey in 2018, be encouraged by this heavenly scene in the future as described in Revelation 7:9, 10:


“After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, saying, ‘Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!’”


Thank you for your faithfulness in praying for more people to join us there on that great day. 


**Ready to start again? Our 2019 prayer journey around the world begins again next week on World Prayer Today.**
