 An exciting day to come


December 20, 2018




Today we’re thanking God for how He is at work in the Netherlands, or Holland, as it was formerly called. This northern European nation has historically deep Christian roots but has fallen a bit into spiritual apathy masked simply as “tolerance.” Pray for people to turn back to the strong faith in God that their grandparents had. 


Lars, from the Netherlands, shares this hope: 


*“What a wonderful broadcast this morning! My wife and I got tears in our eyes with the study of 1 Corinthians 15 because the Holy Spirit touched our hearts again. We learned today that by means of a signal from Him, the trumpet shall sound, and we will meet Him in the air to be with Him forever! What a celebration we will have! The brothers and sisters who have died in Him will rise up and lead the way. Maybe we will experience this together? Wouldn’t that be wonderful? Even so come, Lord Jesus. Even so, there is still much work to do, because in our hearts are so many people that we would love to bring with us!”*


Thank God for His grace that He gives to us when we sense His Spirit at work in our lives. 


**Tomorrow we’ll enjoy a special celebration right here on World Prayer Today.**
