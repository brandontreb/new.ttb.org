 “You’ve stayed in my heart since I was young”


December 04, 2018




*“**I belong to the generation that listened to you while growing up.”* 


Praise the Lord today for His faithfulness in keeping *Thru the Bible* on the radio through several generations now. 


This greeting from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico (on the Texas border), speaks to God’s provision of keeping *Thru the Bible* on the radio—and now available through so many varied ways of listening. 


Uriel shares this: 


*“I’ve been listening to you on my iPhone since November 2012 and I follow you by downloading the podcasts to feed my spirit. Thanks to the Eternal One and to you. My soul delights listening to the study of His Holy Word, faithful and true. When I was a child, my mother would listen to you on KBNL, Radio Manantial in Laredo, TX. Now I am 35 years old and it is incredible how this program has stayed in my heart. I belong to the generation that listened to you while growing up. Now I love the Lord Jesus Christ with all my soul and heart.”* 


Praise the Lord with the testimony of Psalm 78:4—*“*We will not hide [Your truth] from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, and His strength and His wonderful works that He has done.”


**The celebration continues tomorrow right here on World Prayer Today. Don’t miss the joy of God at work.**
