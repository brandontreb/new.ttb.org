 Share good tidings of great joy for all people


December 21, 2018




Just as the Apostle Paul encouraged the Corinthians with the process of how someone comes to salvation and growth (“I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase,” 1 Corinthians 3:6), we too can be encouraged to see how Hamlig, a brother in Christ in Gyumri, Armenia, came to his new life in Christ. 


*“When the earthquake struck our region in 1999, I was 10 years old. We were given care packages, and in one of the boxes I discovered a Bible. I took it as my own and began reading it, though I understood very little. A few years later, a friend of my parents came to our home to share what he believed about Jesus Christ. I remembered some of what I had read in my Bible and it all made sense. I was very happy that day to repent of my sins, turn to Jesus as my Savior, and be forgiven and cleansed and given a new identity. Now I listen to* Thru the Bible *every night and I am blessed through it. When I ponder what I learn, I find inner peace. I am grateful to all of those who invested their energy and finance in the preparation of your programs. Thank you for thinking about our country.”*


Praise God for how He uses each of us—some to give Bibles, some to pray, some to share Jesus with neighbors, some to financially support, some to teach—as important parts of His plan to share the gift of His Son with the world.  Are you praying for people in countries you’ll never meet on earth? Keep it up!—God is using you to share the “good tidings of great joy which will be to all people.”  


**Join us next week as the celebration continues right here on World Prayer Today.**
