 Praying for pastors


December 12, 2018




In the small and landlocked country of eSwatini (formerly Swaziland), trained pastors and church leaders are hard to find. 


So as we continue our month-long celebration of praise, let’s remember to thank God for those who are answering His call—like this young gentleman who listens to *Thru the Bible* in his native language of Zulu.


*“A few years ago while tuning in to your Bible teaching program, Jesus saved me. As I listened that day I was deeply convicted and I gave my life to Him right then and there. The more I listened, the more I was burdened to share the gospel with others. Little by little I realized that God was calling me to serve Him as a pastor. So now I’m in my second year of theological training … although through your messages I feel I’ve been in training much longer. Thank you for introducing me to God’s Word … I hope to do the same for many others in my lifetime.”*


What a great letter! Today let’s praise God for all those who serve His church. And let’s pray that He will raise up a whole new generation of Christian ministers in every country of the world.


**Tomorrow we hear the salvation story of a drug addict in India. Invite a friend to join us for this amazing testimony.**
