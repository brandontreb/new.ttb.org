 Too late to turn to God?


October 02, 2018




Is it ever too late to turn to God?


That’s what a woman asked the *Thru the Bible* producer in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. She had come to the station’s family counseling night and sat through two workshops without saying a word. As she bundled up to leave, she whispered this question to our producer. 


*“As long as you have breath*,” he responded. 


Pray for the many people in Mongolia who are discovering peace with God and forgiveness of their sins when they turn to Jesus Christ as their Savior. This message of grace and mercy is new to Mongolia—only in this past generation have Christian radio and the Bible in their own language been available. Pray that a strong foundation will be built on faith in God and the truth of His Word. 


**Tomorrow we’ll travel on our knees to the beautiful country of Taiwan. Join us here again and get ready to pray.**
