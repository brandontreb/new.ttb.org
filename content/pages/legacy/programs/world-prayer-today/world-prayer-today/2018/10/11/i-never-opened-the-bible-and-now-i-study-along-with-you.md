 “I never opened the Bible, and now I study along with you”


October 11, 2018




*Bienvenido!* Welcome! Today our world prayer journey brings us to Idaho where we meet a listener of our Spanish language broadcast named Leticia.


She gladly shares:


*“I want to thank you for your beautiful program. It was listening to your program that opened my eyes to the Lord Jesus Christ. I had never opened the Bible, and now I study it along with you. I can’t stop reading it, and I feel like the happiest woman on the planet because I have Christ in my heart. I now share your program with my family in San Juan del Rio Oro, Mexico. Thank you very, very much. My offering is not much, but I give it with all my heart.”*


What great news! Today let’s pray that more people will hear our Spanish language broadcast and come to a saving relationship with Jesus Christ, both here in the United States and around the world.
