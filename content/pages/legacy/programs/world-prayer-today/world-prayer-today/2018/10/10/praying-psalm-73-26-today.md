 Praying Psalm 73:26 today


October 10, 2018




Psalm 73:26 says *“My flesh and my heart fail;* *but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.”* 


And that’s also the encouragement we receive today from James in Surrey, British Columbia. He writes:


*“**I first heard Dr. McGee back in 2002. I was saved in January 2000, and since then I have been stumbling along, each day getting more firm in my salvation. Dr. McGee's broadcast is an essential part of my day now. We have an 18-year-old son who has cerebral palsy, so daily life can be exhausting; and nothing ever can or will give us what the Bible does. Some days, God is literally our strength. That sounds odd to read the last sentence, but it's a powerful and simple fact. Thanks for doing what you do.”*


Amen! Today let’s intercede for all those who rely on God to get them through each day. Pray that the Lord will meet them in their need and fill them with His strength and power each day.


**Join us tomorrow as we travel to Idaho and meet a listener of our Spanish language broadcast.**
