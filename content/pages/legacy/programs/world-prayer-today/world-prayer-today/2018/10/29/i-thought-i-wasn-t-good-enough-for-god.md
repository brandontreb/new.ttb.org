 “I thought I wasn’t good enough for God…”


October 29, 2018




*“Like many people here, I was afraid to pick up the Bible and read it.”* 


Welcome to World Prayer Today. That’s the way a listener of our Amharic broadcast in Ethiopia began her letter to us. Listen now as she explains more,


*“I was afraid because I can’t read well and I thought I couldn’t understand it. I was afraid because I thought I wouldn’t be good enough for God. But since I became a regular listener of your program, God has been knocking at the door of my heart. Now, I have no fear and I read a little each day, praise God! Thank you for the many truths and courage you’ve given me. There are many here who can’t read, and I praise God that through you they can hear God’s Word and know Him. Please keep broadcasting.”*


She’s right—more than two-thirds of Ethiopians can’t read or write. So today let’s praise God that He uses *Thru the Bible* to knock at the door of their hearts with His Word. Through these efforts, let’s pray more people will come to know and love our Savior, Jesus Christ. 


**Our prayer journey through Africa continues tomorrow in Somalia, please join us.**
