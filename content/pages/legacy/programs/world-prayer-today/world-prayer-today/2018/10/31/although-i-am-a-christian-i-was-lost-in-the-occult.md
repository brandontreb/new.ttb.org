 “Although I am a Christian, I was lost in the occult”


October 31, 2018




*“Although I am a Christian, I was lost in fetishes and a lot of other occult practices.”*


That’s the letter we received from a listener in Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast). He continues:


*“But now I know that God is bigger than these rituals and I can run to Him for deliverance. I have already abandoned the path of the fetishes, but I have some difficulties with voodoo; please pray that I would be rid of it completely.”*


Today let’s pray for all believers who are affected by the power of their tribal religions. In the name of Jesus, let’s ask for complete deliverance from the darkness and the draw of these practices. And through the process, let’s pray they will bring glory to God and be light to all those around them.
