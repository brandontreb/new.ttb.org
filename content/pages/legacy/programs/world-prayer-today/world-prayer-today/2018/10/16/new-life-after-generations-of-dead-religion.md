 New life after generations of dead religion


October 16, 2018




Communism may be gone from central Europe, but its effects still linger. 


Today the World Prayer Team visits Romania where generations of formal, dead religion have left their mark. People doubt if God is the answer or the Bible is true. In spite of the obstacles, God is reaching people through the broadcast of His Word. 


Letters like this one from Nerijus encourage us to pray!


*“I am 24 and recently I received the greatest gift of all—God’s mercy through His Son, Jesus. Your programs help me to better understand the Bible and get deeper into the Word of God. It is very hard to find Bible-teaching churches in my area, so I rely on you to help me grow in my faith. Each day I wait for you eagerly.* *Our heavenly Father is amazing and faithful, and so many times He let Himself be known to me through your broadcasts. I never need to feel alone because through His Word He shows me He is always with me. To Him be all thanks and glory.* *With many thanks.”*


Today in Romania, remember to pray for the 20-something generation to turn to Jesus for hope. Like Nerijus, may they discover salvation in Jesus’ name and a peace that passes understanding. 


**We’ll continue to pray through central Europe tomorrow with a visit to Serbia.**
