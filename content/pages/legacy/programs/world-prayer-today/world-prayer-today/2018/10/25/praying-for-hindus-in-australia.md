 Praying for Hindus in Australia


October 25, 2018




G’day mate! Welcome to Australia. As our world prayer journey touches down in this warm and friendly country, we ask you to join us in praying for *Thru the Bible’s* broadcast in the Hindi language.


Although reports estimate there are only about 65,000 Hindus in Australia, Hinduism is the fastest growing religion here. 


Please join us in praying for the Hindi broadcasts of *Thru the Bible* to have great effectiveness in the hearts of those in Australia, and also for those impacted by these broadcasts in India and around the globe. 


**Tomorrow we travel inland to the island nation of Indonesia. Pray with us then.**
