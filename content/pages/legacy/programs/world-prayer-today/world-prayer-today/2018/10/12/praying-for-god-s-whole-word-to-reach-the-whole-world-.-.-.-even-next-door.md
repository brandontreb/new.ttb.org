 Praying for God’s whole Word to reach the whole world . . . even next door


October 12, 2018




The whole Word to the whole world—that’s the vision Dr. J. Vernon McGee, *Thru the Bible’s* founder and teacher, cast years ago and what we’re still following today. 


Welcome to World Prayer Today! Today we’re celebrating the impact of God’s Word around the world—and also here at home. Enjoy these emails sent from two young women living here in the United States.


Mina writes:


*“I thank the Lord for your Arabic language program, and I pray that your ministry would keep spreading and telling all nations about Jesus’ work for us and that your episodes would lead many to their salvation through Christ! Your efforts are making a difference in my life and I believe in many other lives as well!”*


And Rana shares:


*“Thank you so much for the treasure of your Arabic daily broadcast. There are many of us who are thirsty for the Word. We enjoy your teachings and each day we better understand the meaning of the Bible and its importance in our lives.”* 


Praise the Lord for young people who study the Bible! No matter what language they speak, let’s ask the Lord to bless them as they seek to know Him better and live their lives according to His Word.


**Next week we’re praying our way through central Europe. Please join us here and invite your friends to sign up at** **[**TTB.org/pray**](http://www.ttb.org/pray)****.**
