 Doing the most important thing in life . . .


April 02, 2018




It’s a son’s generous gift that Mrs. B. L. wrote to tell us about today. 


From her home in Azerbaijan, a Eurasian country at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, this faithful sister in Christ wanted to listen to Bible teaching on *Thru the Bible*. Unfortunately, the program was no longer available on her station. But the Lord provided . . . 


*“I would like to share my joy with you. I missed your program so much that my son downloaded it from the Internet in our language and presented me with the CDs of the studies from Genesis to Revelation. Now I can listen. It is the grace of God to me. I am grateful for brother McGee who is with the Lord already …. The studies are very clear and it touches the soul. I share my CDs with others who visit me. Together, we are doing the most important thing in this life: Proclaiming the truth of God for this world.”*


As we pray each day for God’s Word to touch people’s lives, we partner together with this dear sister in proclaiming God’s truth to the world. 


**Tomorrow we’ll pray across** **Kazakhstan where we’ll meet a woman who “reads the Bible like a hungry man!”** **Meet you on our knees tomorrow.**
