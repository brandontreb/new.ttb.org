 Let’s pray they will “understand how wonderful Jesus is”


April 25, 2018




Today our world prayer journey brings us to Tucson, Arizona, where we receive encouragement from a listener named Nancy.


*“I am still listening and learning! I am in a wheelchair with a progressive disease, and I need the encouragement and reminders daily that Dr. McGee teaches in God’s Word. I post on Facebook to encourage family and friends, too. I am hoping God’s Word reaches loved ones, friends, and anybody who happens to scroll by. I will be forever grateful to the people who continue to add one language at a time so we can hear and understand how wonderful Jesus is! I am praying the whole Word to the whole world will be reached soon, especially my 11-year-old daughter, husband, and sons. Will you pray for them too?”*


Well, there we have it! It is our privilege today to pray for the family members and friends of everyone who listens to *Thru the Bible*. As Nancy puts it, let’s pray they will hear God’s Word and “understand how wonderful Jesus is.”


**Join us tomorrow as the adventure continues in Haiti.**
