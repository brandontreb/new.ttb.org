 “Your broadcasts are a lifeline to me”


April 11, 2018




Welcome to Jordan! 


In a country where more than 96% percent of people are Muslim, you may be surprised to hear that God’s Word is taking root in hearts and lives of listeners like Najeeb, who says:


*“Thank you for teaching me about the eternal life I am offered through the Lord Jesus Christ. And thank you for your broadcasts that are a lifeline to me. As I hear your words, I feel the gentle hands of God surrounding me, and I’m not afraid anymore. Please keep broadcasting and pray that more people in Jordan will respond to God’s Word in faith.”*


It’s true, isn’t it? Regardless of where we live, God’s Word is a lifeline to *all* of us. Let’s pray for Najeeb’s homeland of Jordan even as we pray for our own. May the broadcasting of God’s Word bring revival throughout our lands.


**Join us tomorrow as our travels take us to the island of Cyprus.**
