 “I greet you back!”


April 05, 2018




*“Dear Brothers and Sisters, I greet all you prayer warriors in the name of the One who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life,”* greets a wonderful sister in Christ who lives in Moscow. 


She is grateful for every prayer, she writes, and for the familiar voice of *Thru the Bible* on the radio. 


*“I want to tell you,”* she continues, *“that I always respond to your greetings to the listeners. I know that you cannot hear me, but I wanted you to know that I greet you back. I say, ‘In the name of the One we both love, I send you greeting!’”*


At the end of her long letter, our sister writes encouragement for us all: 


*“What a gift we have in the God-breathed Word of God. Our comfort, our help, a light unto our path. Best of all, it points us to Jesus. I am 74 years of age and my only regret is that I didn’t find Him sooner.”* 


What a great reminder that it is a joy to trust Jesus. Lift up to Him today the faithful ones around the world who love and follow Him. 


**Tomorrow we’ll meet a man named Urey from Turkmenistan who said, “I couldn’t believe my ears!”**
