 “You keep me from loneliness and depression”


April 30, 2018




In John 16:33, Jesus says, *“*These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you willhave tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”


Welcome to World Prayer Today. We stop in Mount Vernon, New York, in our journey where one young listener shares how God’s Word has given her peace.


*“I thank God for sending you to help me to grow in the Lord; you keep me from loneliness and depression. My pastor kept telling me about your broadcast. I thank God I finally took his advice. I tell all my friends about your teaching now. I hope and pray that one day they take my advice too so they may experience the peace and joy He’s given to me.”*


Let’s join her in that prayer and ask God that more people will hear His Word and receive the peace that is only offered through His Son, Jesus Christ. 


**Join us tomorrow in Pasadena, California, as a listener prompts us to pray for *Thru the Bible’s* staff and board of directors.**
