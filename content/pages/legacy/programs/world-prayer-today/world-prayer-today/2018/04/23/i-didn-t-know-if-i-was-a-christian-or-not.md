 “I didn’t know if I was a Christian or not …”


April 23, 2018




This week our world prayer journey brings us to North America, where today we have the privilege of visiting the California home of Julia who listens to *Thru the Bible* in Spanish. 


She shares:


*“It is a great joy for me to be able to greet you in the mighty name of our Lord Jesus. I used to listen to you when I was very young because my mom always turned on the radio to listen to your program. For many years I lost sight of you, but about four years ago we were reunited and you have become my pastor. Before, I did not know if I was a Christian or not. But now I am convinced that I want to live with Christ and I want to be with Him until the last day of my life. Please never stop these teachings as they are such a blessing.”*


Let’s pray that everyone who hears *Thru the Bible* in North America will come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. 


**Our journey continues tomorrow in Quebec, Canada.**
