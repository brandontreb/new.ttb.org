 Haiti—eight years after devastation


April 26, 2018




Seven hundred miles off the coast of Miami, Florida, the good news of God’s saving grace is being broadcast on the island of Haiti in the beautiful language of Creole. 


A little more than eight years ago, on January 12, 2010, a 7.3 devastating earthquake struck Haiti. More than 220,000 people were killed and over 300,000 injured. In the aftermath of this massive earthquake, the biggest the region had seen in 200 years, humanitarian aid rushed to the scene to rescue and eventually rebuild. One positive result of restructuring was a better infrastructure to the promotion and delivery of Christian radio. 


Relatedly, *Thru the Bible* has recently experienced a large increase in the number of downloads of the Creole program. Pray that as more people realize that spiritual help and encouragement are available online that these numbers will continue to grow and more lives will be blessed by the Word of God. Pray also that visitors to the website will encourage their friends and relatives in Haiti to become regular listeners of the radio programs.


**Tomorrow we’re off to Canada, with more petitions for its people.**
