 For every family who is praying for a prodigal . . .


April 16, 2018




For every family who is praying for a prodigal son or daughter, this beautiful testimony will renew your hope in God: 


*“I was born and brought up in a Christian family, where I was taught to read the Bible and pray on a regular basis. Initially I was doing all the spiritual activities, and my parents were very happy when they saw me growing spiritually. I was living a God-fearing life till late in high school. College introduced me to new friends and wrong habits. Satan is very clever, and unknowingly I fell into his trap. I would try to deceive my parents, but eventually they knew that I went away from the Lord. I eventually left the house and went to my uncle’s house in another village. By this time I had totally drifted away from God.*


*“My uncle and aunt are regular listeners of the* Thru the Bible *program. They loved me and tried to bring me back to the Lord Jesus without my notice. They invited me to listen to* Thru the Bible *with them. One evening as we listened, the Word of God touched my heart. The preacher shared from John 15. He spoke about a life without God and I realized I was living that life. I lost my relationship with God, with my parents. I lost my health; I lost everything. I was scared after listening to that heart-touching message. I repented of my sins and asked God to restore me. Today I am a regular listener of the* Thru the Bible *program and am growing in my life with God. I praise Him for the great joy He brought in my life. Please remember me in your prayers.”*


Praise God for His redeeming love today, and for welcoming every prodigal back to Himself. 


**Tomorrow we travel on our knees to Japan. See you then.**
