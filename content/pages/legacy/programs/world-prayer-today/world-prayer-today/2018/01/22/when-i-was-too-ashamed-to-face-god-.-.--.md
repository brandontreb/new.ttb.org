 “When I was too ashamed to face God . . .”


January 22, 2018




No matter where we live on this earth, our hearts essentially are the same—we are lost and hopeless until we find Jesus Christ as Savior of our souls. 


This listener from southwest China, Yunnan Province, shares his journey from darkness to light: 


“*When I first tuned into your program, my life was at its most hopeless. Suicidal thoughts occupied my mind every day. My cousin learned of my painful situation and traveled all the way from Shenzhen to visit me. He brought a small radio with him and recommended I tune in to the Christian radio station.*


*“Fortunately, I took his advice … and have been listening ever since. In the past two years, you walked beside me through the most trying times of my life. When I was too ashamed to face God and at the brink of abandoning my faith, you gave me confidence and strength in God. Your encouragement helped me turn to God and ask for His forgiveness. When I was hurting and weak, you told me where to find the courage to continue living—in the God of my faith. I pray your broadcasts will help others just like me turn away from their sins and follow the Lord.”* 


Let’s echo his prayer today that others in China—and in our own communities—will turn from their sins and follow Jesus. 


**Tomorrow, we’ll travel on our knees to Japan.**
