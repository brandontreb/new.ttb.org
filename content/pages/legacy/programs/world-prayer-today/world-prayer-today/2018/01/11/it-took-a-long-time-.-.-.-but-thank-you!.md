## 
 It took a long time . . . but thank you!


January 11, 2018




When you hear the gospel and it contradicts everything that you’ve been taught, it may take a long time for you to understand and believe. 


Bontov, a young man in Uzbekistan, was brought up to believe in many gods who were to be feared. When he first heard about Jesus Christ, it took a long time to process the different thinking that led him to a saving faith in Jesus Christ. He writes: 


*“I listened to your broadcasts for several years, on and off. I would hear something, think on it, and wait to see how God’s Word would work inside me. My life has been changing slowly. Six months ago I finally made a decision to go to church and give my life to Jesus. I only wish I had done it sooner. Looking back, I see that you were right: I’m on this earth to live for God. He loves me beyond measure, and to be used by Him is the greatest joy that exists in the world.”*


Intercede for others like Bontov who are slowly coming to grasp how deep and how wide is God’s love for them. As you pray today, be glad in the truth Bontov expresses: “*To be used by Him is the greatest joy that exists in the world.”*


**Tomorrow, we’ll pray across Russia.**
