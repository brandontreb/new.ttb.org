 Listening . . . in the grip of darkness


January 25, 2018




There are places on earth where you put your life in jeopardy for even listening to the gospel. One listener who used to live in such a place asks us to pray: 


*“I am writing to thank you for the grace I received through the sound of the gospel. You helped me discover salvation in God. I once lived in a place where the government forbid us to listen to Christian radio. If by chance you discovered it and listened, you put your life in danger. Please pray for the brothers and sisters who live in the grip of darkness. Pray for light to get to them.”*


Today, entrust to God those who follow the Lord in secret. Pray that the Lord will not only sustain their faith, but help them to live for God in tremendously difficult situations. If you walk with the Lord today without fear, then pray boldly for those who don’t know this freedom. Perhaps when you see North Korea in the news, intercede for the many secret Christians who live there. 


**We’re off to nearby Taiwan tomorrow. Join us on your knees.**
