 Finding freedom from sin


January 29, 2018




Thanks for joining us on World Prayer Today. 


Our journey this week brings us home to North America where we have the privilege of praising God and praying with our neighbors and friends—including a fellow Bible Bus traveler named Harold from Portage, Indiana. He writes:


*“Praise God from whom all blessings flow. Thank you,* Thru the Bible *staff, for continuing the work Dr. McGee started many years ago. I was a hell-bound sinner lost without hope, addicted to crack cocaine, homeless, and destitute. However, I met a man who led me to Christ and to Dr. McGee’s radio program. Today I’m free of cocaine and I send the money I would use for drugs to support TTB. Thank you God!”*


Isn’t that remarkable? Today let’s join Harold in praising the Lord for His mercy that finds us when we are broken and restores our souls! And let’s pray that wherever God’s truth is heard more people will find freedom and deliverance from their sins by trusting in Jesus.


**Tomorrow we’re praying in Alberta, Canada. Hop aboard for the ride, won’t you?**
