 A new day in Ulaanbaatar


January 24, 2018




Today we celebrate God’s faithfulness as we pray for the people in Mongolia, as many are hearing *Thru the Bible*’s broadcast for the first time. 


If you recall, as a World Prayer Team we prayed that God would make a way for the broadcast to be heard in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia’s capital city and where the most concentrated population of the country lives. 


God answered our prayer in 2014 and today we’re hearing about a great response from the Christian station that hosts *Thru the Bible*. Pray today for the leaders of this station. Not only do they broadcast God’s Word, but they also have face-to-face interactions with their listeners as they host seminars and workshops in their offices. We’ve heard that as people hear the good news on the radio, they are willing to come together and learn more. 


Pray specifically for the growth and protection of the Christian homes in Mongolia. Since the gospel is so new in their country, every family is a first-generation Christian family. 


**Tomorrow we travel on our knees to North Korea.**
