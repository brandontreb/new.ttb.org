 God’s Word is changing families


January 31, 2018




*Buenos dias!* We touch down today in Los Angeles, California, where a young listener of *Thru the Bible* meets us and gladly shares:


*“My name is Loreyn and I thank God for you and for* A Través de la Biblia*. My father was saved over 20 years ago listening to your program, and I have been listening to you since I was a little girl. Today my father is in the presence of the Lord, but I am still studying along with you.* 


*“I cannot find the words to express my gratitude for the joy of listening every day, but I pray that God blesses you and those that listen to His Word.”*


Like Loreyn, let’s pray for those who hear God’s Word today. Specifically ask Him that the Good News of Jesus Christ will bring many more of our Spanish-speaking listeners into a saving relationship with Jesus … just like it did more than 20 years ago for Loreyn’s dad. 


And if you’d like to introduce someone you know to the Spanish version of our broadcasts, visit us at [TTB.org](http://www.TTB.org/spanish) to find out how.


**Our worldwide prayer journey continues tomorrow in Quebec, Canada. We hope you’ll join us!**
