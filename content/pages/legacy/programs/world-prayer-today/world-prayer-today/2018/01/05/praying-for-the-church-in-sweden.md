 Praying for the church in Sweden


January 05, 2018




*Välkommen*! Welcome to Sweden. We’re so glad you’ve joined us today as we stop and pray with *Thru the Bible*’s Swedish producer, Curt Westman.


According to Curt, churches in Sweden are facing a serious decline in attendance as people’s interest in spiritual matters is waning.


So today, let’s pray for Curt and for *Thru the Bible*’s listeners in Sweden. May their love for God and His Word spark a revival in their country and, in return, may God’s church begin to flourish and grow there.


And while we’re at it, let’s also pray for Alf Telefson, *Thru the Bible*’s producer of the Lapp program that reaches the 25,000 Sami people who live in the far north of Sweden and Norway. May God’s Word ignite their community, as well.


**Next week, the World Prayer Team travels the highways of Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States.**
