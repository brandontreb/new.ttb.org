 Praying for single parents


January 04, 2018




Our global prayer journey continues today in Portugal where we have the privilege of meeting with a single mom who shares:


*“I am a divorced woman and I have five children. Often I do not know how to teach my children about spiritual things and have begun to listen to your program for guidance. Thank you for helping me in the education of my children. Please pray they grow up to seek God in all that they do.”*


What a great request! Today, let’s intercede for all single parents who are fulfilling the roles of both mother *and* father. Pray that God will give them the strength, wisdom, and patience they need to teach and serve their children in a way that glorifies Him. 


**Tomorrow the World Prayer Team is off to the gorgeous country of Sweden.**
