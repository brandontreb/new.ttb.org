 Praying for the financially wealthy, but spiritually poor


January 02, 2018




Welcome aboard, World Prayer Team members! Today we travel to Finland where *Thru the Bible* broadcasts both on FM radio and the Internet. 


As we touch down, Jukka Norvanto, our Finnish producer, greets us and shares his burden for his countrymen.


*“Although Finland is known as one of the more affluent and peaceful countries on earth,”* he explains, *“many people here are spiritually poor. Please pray our broadcasts will energize our country and will spark a revival of true love for our God and His Word.”*


Well, that’s a great way to pray! Let’s join Jukka in asking God to bless the broadcasting of His Word in Finland. Let’s also ask Him to bless Jukka’s efforts and the work of the rest of *Thru the Bible*’s team. May their love for the Lord be contagious and ignite the hearts and minds of the Finnish people for His glory.


**Tomorrow we’re off to Italy.**
