 Who teaches the teachers?


January 10, 2018




Who teaches the Bible teachers in isolated places? Praise God for programs like *Thru the Bible* that minister to those who are in turn ministering to people in spiritually barren places. 


Mr. T.N. writes us from Turkmenistan, northwest of Afghanistan: 


*“Dear workers in the Lord’s vineyard! Thank you for your lectures on* Thru the Bible*. What valuable material, rich with illustrations from our daily life and immortal souls. These lectures help me as a pastor to think of spiritual food I can later feed the people in my local church. My leaders and I always listen to your programs. We wait for them. They edify us, reprimand us, and help us to grow in faith. Pray for the church in my country, please.”* 


Let’s pray now: 


Father, we do intercede for the church in Turkmenistan. Thank You for the mercy and grace You extend to them today as they walk with You in a spiritually needy place. We especially lift up their pastors and leaders. Teach them Your ways and give them wisdom to serve Your people there. Amen.


**Tomorrow, our final visit to the ’Stans this month.**
