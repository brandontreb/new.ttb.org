 Timeless truth . . . up to date delivery


January 26, 2018




We’re grateful to hear from a new sister in Taiwan named Moza who told us that she’s on the Bible Bus, traveling with *Thru the Bible* on our 5-year journey through the Word of God. We got this text from her recently: 


*“I am a new believer in Jesus Christ. Since a year ago I began to go to church. A friend of mine told me about your 5-year travel through the Bible. I began to listen to your podcast and was very glad for the clear explanation of the Word of God. Since I am new, I have not read the entire Bible, so I think this is a wonderful possibility to go through the entire program with you. Thank you for saving me a seat on the Bible Bus.”* 


What great news! Pray for those around the world who are hearing the whole Word for the first time!

**On Monday, we’re praying on the other side of the world.**
