 Praying for the 20-somethings in Armenia


January 08, 2018




From Gyumri, the second largest city in Armenia, we hear an encouraging word today from a 20-year-old girl named Susanna. 


She writes:


*“I am a student, and I very much like to listen to your program once I have completed my home studies. I also like to sing spiritual songs. I read my Bible, then I listen to your programs as we go book by book through God’s holy Scripture. When I listen to you I don’t feel the distance that separates us. Really, our Lord has made us sisters and brothers. And I always feel you. Thank you for your prayers on my behalf and others of my generation. We are looking for the truth.”*


That’s the kind of request we love to pray for on our world prayer tour. Pray for young adults like Susanna, who are making God’s Word a part of their lives. Right now, intercede for them—thanking God that He will provide for their spiritual needs as they walk with Him. 


**Through the next few days, we’ll be traveling on our knees through “the ̓Stans.”**
