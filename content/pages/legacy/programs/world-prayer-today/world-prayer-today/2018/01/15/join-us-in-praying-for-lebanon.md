 Join us in praying for Lebanon


January 15, 2018




Today our world prayer journey brings us to the mysterious country of Lebanon where we meet with a young woman named Sarah who faithfully listens to *Thru the Bible*. 


She says:


*“I want to know more about the Word of God because what you are teaching me is making a difference in my life and relationship with God. Thank you for making me want to know more about my Creator.”*


That’s the great thing about God’s Word—the more time you spend in it, the more time you *want* to spend in it!


Today as we listen to *Thru the Bible,* let’spray it brings clarity to those who don’t yet have a relationship with the Lord and pray it brings encouragement to those who do … particularly those in Lebanon.
