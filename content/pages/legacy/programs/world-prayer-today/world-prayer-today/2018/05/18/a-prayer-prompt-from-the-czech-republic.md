## 
 A prayer prompt from the Czech Republic


May 18, 2018




One of the great things about being a part of this World Prayer Team is the opportunity we have to encourage one another. 


Today our encouragement comes from a fellow prayer warrior in the Czech Republic who writes:


*“I greet you in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior. Through Him we are brothers and sisters with one goal: to share His love with the world. I want to encourage you to keep praying for those who are lost, because I can say from my personal experience that there are often lonely people who accept the Holy Spirit through your programs and receive guidance in the difficult situations in their lives. So together let’s continue to pray that more people hear the Good News and receive it …. May God bless you for this work. To Him be all thanks and glory.”*


What a great reminder that God is answering our prayers. This is a wonderful prompt to keep praying! As we bow our heads today, let’s also follow our friend’s lead and give God all the thanks and the glory!
