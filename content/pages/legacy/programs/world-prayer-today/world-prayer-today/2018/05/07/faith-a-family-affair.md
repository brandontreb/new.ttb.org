 Faith: A family affair


May 07, 2018




Proverbs 22:6 says, *“**Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.”*


 


 


Thanks for joining us on this world prayer tour. Today our journey brings us to the exotic land of Assam, India, where we receive this word of encouragement from a listener named Laiput:


 


 


*“As a twelve-year-old boy, I vividly recall hearing my father listen to* Thru the Bible *on the radio. I didn’t pay much attention to it then, but later in my teens I began to listen to it with him. It was through these programs that I learned more about salvation and sin. Slowly and surely my doubts about Jesus subsided and* *I publicly accepted Christ.*


 


 


*“Shortly after, I began to distribute spiritual booklets in our village, and today there are seven Christian families worshipping the Lord Jesus there. Recently I attended seminary and have become an evangelist. I’m so grateful for my father’s quiet and steady Christian influence in my life. My father and* Thru the Bible *pointed me to Jesus.”*


 


What a great story. Today let’s praise God for faithful parents around the world and ask the Lord to bless them as they raise the next generation of godly leaders.


 


 


**Tomorrow we travel to Nepal. Please join us!**
