 “The Bible is alive to me!”


May 30, 2018




As we touch down today in the gorgeous and peaceful country of Gabon, Africa, we are greeted by a *Thru the Bible* listener who is excited to share her story: 


*“The Bible is alive to me! Through your programs I can now understand it clearly. I am a retired mother and listen to your African English broadcast every morning. I found you quite by mistake one day when I was feeling down. So now I never miss it unless there is a power outage … and then I pray for your return.* 


*“You have filled my hunger for the Word and daily I am becoming a better Christian. I have told friends, especially new Christians, to listen to you, and hopefully one day we will be able to form a Bible study and use our knowledge to help others in remote areas. Will you join us in praying that God’s Word will transform every heart in Gabon?”*


What a wonderful and bold request. Wherever you are and whatever you’re doing today, please pray for the transformation of every heart in Gabon. May God’s Word penetrate hearts and bring them to their knees in glad surrender to God.


**Join us tomorrow as we travel to Kenya!**
