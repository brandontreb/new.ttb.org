 “I thought that God wanted nothing more to do with me . . .”


May 03, 2018




*“I thought that God wanted nothing more to do with me ….”* That’s how a listener named Jeff from Brewerton, New York, began his recent letter.


*“I was a wandering Christian who had fallen into a sinful lifestyle. I had no future and no hope. Thank you for helping me to see that God still cares and that there is always hope. I have repented and forsaken my sinful lifestyle and turned to Jesus for forgiveness. I pray that God will use this small donation and multiply it to bring people to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. Thank you for always being there and God bless you all.”*


Jeff is right—there is *always* hope in Jesus. Do you know someone who needs to hear that today? As you pray for them, will you also pray for those listening to *Thru the Bible* who need to hear that word as well? Let’s together ask God to open hearts to the message of His love and forgiveness.
