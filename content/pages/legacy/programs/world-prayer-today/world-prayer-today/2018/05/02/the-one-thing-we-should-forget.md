 The one thing we should forget


May 02, 2018




Welcome to Virginia! Today on our World Prayer journey, a listener named Ruth encourages us with these words:


*“It’s been over 50 years since the Spirit of God drew me into His sheltered dwelling place. Jesus said He would never leave me or forsake me. And I’m here to say that He has been proven true to His Word. I’m 75 and it has been a wonderful life in Jesus Christ, a wonderful Savior. And I look forward to many more!”*


Isn’t that great? She’s 75 years old and ready for many more years in the Lord! Her words are reminiscent of Philippians 3:13-14: 


*“Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead,I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.”*


Let’s thank God for encouraging sisters like Ruth, and pray that we too can forget what is behind and focus on what lies ahead as we serve Jesus Christ today.


**Thanks for joining us in the privilege of prayer. Tomorrow we head to New York.**
