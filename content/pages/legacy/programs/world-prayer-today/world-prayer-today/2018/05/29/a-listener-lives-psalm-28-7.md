 A listener lives Psalm 28:7


May 29, 2018




Psalm 28:7 says, *“The**Lord**is**my strength and my shield;* *my heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song I will praise Him.”*


Welcome to World Prayer Today as we travel to the African country of Burkina Faso where one listener similarly encourages us:


*“I am happy to become a Christian! What I noted when I first repented was this big unaccustomed joy that enlivens me again today and this big relief that filled my heart. I pray that through your programs in my language of Bambara that other people, especially my parents, will discover Jesus and also live daily in joy. It is more than I ever hoped for or dreamed.”*


Isn’t that a great encouragement for all of us today? Let’s pray that more people in Burkina Faso will hear God’s Word and be filled with the joy that can only be found in Jesus Christ.


**Join us tomorrow as our journey through Africa continues in Gabon.**
