 “I was pushing myself towards the power of darkness …”


May 09, 2018




*“I was pushing myself towards the power of darkness ….”* That’s what one listener named Gudiya tells us today as our world prayer journey takes us to Punjab, India. 


She explains:


*“I was* *brought up in a strict religious atmosphere. I was required to fulfill all the rituals of my religion and I did so gladly. Everyone in our village used to present me as an example of a devoted and dedicated young woman. But I became ill and violent. As the days passed, I was becoming physically very weak.* 


*“As my situation grew worse, my husband ran into a friend at the market and told him about my condition. This kind man and his friend made a visit to our home and began to pray for me. They also introduced us to* Thru the Bible*. From that day forward we became regular listeners. Through these studies we came to know the real God, His love, and power. Today, I am healthy and I share my story with everyone I meet. Christianity isn’t popular here, and it’s certainly not popular in my extended family. So many live and worship in darkness like I did. Please pray that the light of God’s Word will change their hearts.”*


Let’s honor that great request. As we pray, please ask that the broadcasting of God’s Word will spread like wildfire and overwhelm the darkness in Punjab and all of India.


**Our journey continues tomorrow in Kerala, India . . . hop aboard and join us.**
