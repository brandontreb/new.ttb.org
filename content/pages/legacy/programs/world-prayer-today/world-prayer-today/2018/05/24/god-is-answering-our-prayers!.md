 God is answering our prayers!


May 24, 2018




World Prayer Team, welcome to the Philippines—a country we’ve visited and prayed for several times in the past year. 


Today we’re so glad to share a few text messages we’ve recently received from Filipino listeners telling us about how God is answering our prayers!  


The first one begins: 


*“How happy I am to have found your program … you explain the Word of God so clearly! I have surrendered my life to Christ and couldn’t be more pleased!”*


And another listener recently texted, 


*“Your program continually gives us strength no matter what the day may bring.”* 


And another says, 


“*Through your programs I have found Christ. Please pray for husband; he listens with me but has not yet made a decision.”*


Don’t you love to hear about the changes God’s Word is making in so many lives? Let’s continue our prayers for *Thru the Bible* broadcasts in the Philippines and ask that all who listen will be led to believe.


**Join us tomorrow as we travel on our knees to the Solomon Islands.**
