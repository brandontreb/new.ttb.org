 “Prayer is the breath of a Christian …”


May 22, 2018




In the heart of the world’s most populous Muslim nation**—**Indonesia**—**you may be surprised to hear that God’s Word is taking root. 


As one listener of our Javanese program says, 


*“It is not popular for me to listen to your program, but I don’t care. Whenever I have a burden I know that listening to the Word of God on* Thru the Bible *is the only place I want to go. If I miss a program, I feel as though something is missing from my life. And it is … God’s Word is missing! Thank you for making the Bible so easy to understand and thank you for helping me understand that praying and worshiping God is important. Through you I have learned that prayer is the breath of a Christian. Today I breathe words of praise to you for broadcasting in Javanese. May you continue until our Lord comes back.”*


Isn’t that wonderful? Let’s join her today in “breathing” praise for the Javanese broadcast of *Thru the Bible*. And let’s ask God to open more hearts in Indonesia (and around the world) to the name of Jesus. 


**It’s a privilege to pray and travel the world together. Join us tomorrow as the adventure continues in New Zealand.**
