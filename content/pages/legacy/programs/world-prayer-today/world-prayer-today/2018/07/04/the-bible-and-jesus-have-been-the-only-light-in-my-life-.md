 “The Bible and Jesus have been the only light in my life.”


July 04, 2018




No matter where you live, your heart was made for relationships—and ultimately for a relationship with Jesus Christ. 


Today our World Prayer Team touches down in Moldova, a country in the Commonwealth of Independent States (C.I.S.), landlocked between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. 


The greatest spiritual need that we hear from this small nation that was once part of the disbanded Russian states is for godly leaders in the Christian community. 


One listener, Anka, wrote: 


*“Thank you for your program. It has been supportive to me in this, the hardest time in my life. The Bible and Jesus have been the only light in my life since my daughter passed away.* *This Easter will be my first Easter without her, but I know that on the day of resurrection we will be together again. As I listen to our study in 1 Corinthians, it has helped to feed my faith on a daily basis.”* 


Remember those who are brokenhearted in Moldova and ask the Lord to raise up more godly leaders to serve the body of Christ in C.I.S. And keep praying for God’s Word to reach those in need of a Savior.


**Tomorrow we’ll continue praying through C.I.S. with a stop in Turkmenistan.**
