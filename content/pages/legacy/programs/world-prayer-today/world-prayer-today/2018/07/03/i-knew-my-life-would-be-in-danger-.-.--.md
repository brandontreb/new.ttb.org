 “I knew my life would be in danger . . .”


July 03, 2018




*“I knew my life would be in danger if I decided to follow Jesus,”* wrote a man from Kyrgyzstan.  


*“I always considered myself to be an honest Muslim, even though I didn’t know much about Islam. I had a sincere fear of God within me as well as many questions like, ‘What happens after we die?’ Unfortunately, no one I knew had any answers.* 


*“It was in 1994 that I heard about Jesus Christ for the first time. A friend invited me to go with her to a kind of mosque. When we got there, I realized this was something unlike anything I had seen before. The following week they invited me to another meeting and I realized what I was looking for was Jesus. I accepted Him right then and there.*


*“Since then, your program has been a big help in learning more about Jesus and how to follow Him. After I became a Christian, I knew my life would be in danger. But God has protected me. I still have quite a bit of opposition from my relatives and friends, but I live before them what I believe, and I have had many great opportunities to be a witness for Jesus.”*


Praise the Lord today that those who sincerely seek the Lord with all their hearts find Him. Pray that many others in Kyrgyzstan travel this same road. 


**We’ll pray tomorrow in Moldova. Please join us.**
