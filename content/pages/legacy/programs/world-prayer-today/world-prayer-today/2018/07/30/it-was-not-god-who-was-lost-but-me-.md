 “It was not God who was lost, but me.”


July 30, 2018




*“My youth was spent carelessly, but as I grew older I began to ask many serious questions and search for the truth. A friend suggested that I listen to your program, and imagine my surprise that when I finally found God … He was beside me all along. It was not God who was lost, but me.”*  

  

That’s the wisdom Blandine, a listener of our French broadcast in Canada, shares with us today. She continues:  

  

*“Your teaching opened my eyes, and today I decided to give my heart to God so that He may use me. As Jeremiah 29:13 says ‘You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.’ So I pray that God may use each and every broadcast to open the spiritual eyes of others who are lost … may they too seek and find Him.”*  

  

Let’s join Blandine in praying that verse for everyone who hears *Thru the Bible* today. From Cameroon to Canada, may hearts be quieted and souls overwhelmed by God’s undeniable presence in our lives.  

  

**Join us tomorrow as we travel to sunny Southern California.**
