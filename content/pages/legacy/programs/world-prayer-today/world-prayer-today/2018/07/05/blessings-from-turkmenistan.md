 Blessings from Turkmenistan


July 05, 2018




More than 80% of the country of Turkmenistan is a wasteland—uninhabited and dry. An even greater percentage of the population is spiritually without hope. 


In this Muslim-dominant nation, one of the only ways to share the good news of Jesus Christ is through Christian radio. As one listener shares: 


*“I greet you all dear coworkers for the gospel. I listen to your Bible teaching program, and I want to tell you that I always respond to your greetings to the listeners with a heartfelt, ‘Hello in the strong name of Jesus.’ I know that you cannot hear me, but I wanted you to know that I greet you back in our common heart. I have listened to your programs for seven years now. It is my only way to hear of God. I am not able to give money to support this good effort, but I am sending Scripture verses to remind you of the grace in which we stand.”* 


Here is one from her letter to encourage us: 


*Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept secret since the world began but now made manifest, and by the prophetic Scriptures made known to all nations, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, for obedience to the faith—to God, alone wise, be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.* -Romans 16:25-27


Let’s pray more people in the spiritual desert of Turkmenistan will find hope and life in God’s Word.
