 Find out how a new generation is finding Jesus in Tunisia


July 11, 2018




Today our World Prayer Team travels on our knees to the lovely and inviting country of Tunisia. While more than 99% of Tunisians practice Islam, you may be surprised to hear that a new generation is using technology to discover faith in Jesus. 


*“My name is Murad and Christianity has always been vague to me. Since my childhood I have been interested in Issa* [the Arab name for Christ], *but no one could tell me much about Him. I’ve always wanted to have a Holy Bible, but it is forbidden and not available. But now with your phone app I can not only read the Bible, but listen to you explain it!* 


*“Your programs are a door to light. I do not want each one to end because it is like treasure for me! Many of my friends are listeners too, but they are hesitant to write because of the security issue. On behalf of all of us, please don’t stop broadcasting … you are our only source of truth.”*


Thank God that young listeners like Murad are hearing the truth. Today let’s pray that many others in Tunisia come to treasure God’s Word whether they listen on the radio, via the Internet, or through our handy mobile phone apps.  


**Join us tomorrow as our journey through North Africa and the Middle East continues in Syria.**
