 Sharing the Father with her father


July 18, 2018




Our lives are lived in community; we influence each other. And nothing is more attractive than a life lived in God. 


Here’s a good report from Mongolia—a daughter who found her heavenly Father and shared the Good News with her earthly father:


“*It wasn’t long ago that I heard the Good News on the radio for the first time. I had never before heard about God. I’m thankful to you who have shared the gospel with me. Soon after tuning in to these broadcasts, I started attending the Bible training at the radio station every Saturday, and my spiritual understanding grew deeper. Moreover, I started experiencing real change and miracles in my life. Last winter when so many herders lost their cows from the frigid weather, our cattle survived. It was like a miracle! We thank the good Lord, because He took good care of us. We are getting to know Him better every day thanks to the daily program.”*


Yes, the Lord is good to those who trust Him. He is good—all the time. Just look for it. Together, let’s thank the Lord for blessing His children, and pray others in Mongolia turn to the Lord in faith. 


**Our prayer journey takes us tomorrow to North Korea.**
