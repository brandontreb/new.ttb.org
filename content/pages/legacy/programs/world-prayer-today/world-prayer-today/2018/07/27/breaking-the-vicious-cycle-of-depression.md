 Breaking the vicious cycle of depression


July 27, 2018




*“My name is Ajay. I run a small shop in my village …. I have been a devout person, worshipping gods the way I was taught by my parents. I went on pilgrimages and made sure I appeased my gods. But if it weren't for that constant gnawing within myself that made me feel I was missing something important, I would never have gotten to know about the real Lord and Savior.”* 


Ajay has a great testimony of how God uses each of us to share His Good News. Let’s hear more:


*“One particular day, I felt depressed and wondered if the gods really saw my acts of hard work and penance that I did in their name. This constantly played on my mind, and I found myself getting distracted from work. The vicious cycle of depression, distraction, and unproductivity sucked me into a spiral, when one day a Christian came up to my store and asked me what was wrong. When I told him what I was going through, he shared the gospel with me and gave me instructions to listen to your program.* 


*“After a discussion on prayer and peace, the producer led me in a prayer to ask God for peace. I prayed along and, believe it or not, I found such amazing peace in Jesus. God had given His own peace that He had promised. Soon enough, I accepted the Lord as my personal Savior. Now that I feel in connection with the real God and His peace, I continually want to learn from Him through your program. Please pray for my spiritual growth.”*


Let’s do that right now. 


*Father, thank You for the miracle of salvation that You give to everyone who turns to you in faith. We ask that more people like Ajay come to you through the Hindi broadcast in Samoa where we pray today, as well as other far-flung places on earth.* 


**Continue to pray with us next week.**
