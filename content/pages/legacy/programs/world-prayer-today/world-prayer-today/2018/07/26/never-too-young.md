 Never too young


July 26, 2018




Read the Bible with an eye for people, and you’ll find many young adults making a difference for God: young shepherd boy David, privileged teenage king Josiah, and even Mary—the one chosen by God to bear a miracle. 


Today we visit with a young listener in Southeast Asia about a great life lesson he learned early. He wrote from Vietnam:


*“Your program encourages young adults like me to make the right decisions and stay away from the wrong ones. Last year I failed my graduation exams three times. I was so discouraged. The night before my final opportunity I turned on the radio and tuned into your program. The message that night focused on how there’s nothing God cannot do. He can do anything. Right then, I prayed for the Lord to help me pass my exams. I felt I needed to rely on Him and do my best. Thank you so much for letting me know where to find the strength to face my problems.”* 


Praise the Lord for the lesson this young man can teach us all. By the way, his P.S. read: *“Praise be to God—I passed my exam!”* Pray today that we turn to God in our challenges—and intercede for the young people who listen to *Thru the Bible* around the world.


**We’ll continue our prayer journey tomorrow in the tropical South Pacific island of Samoa.**
