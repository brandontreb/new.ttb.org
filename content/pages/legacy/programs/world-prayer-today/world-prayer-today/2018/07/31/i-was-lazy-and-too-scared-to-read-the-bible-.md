 “I was lazy and too scared to read the Bible.”


July 31, 2018




It’s been said that theBible is God’s unparalleled love letter to His people*.*So if that’s true, why don’t more Christians regularly read the Bible? 


Thanks for joining us as our world prayer journey continues today with a stop in Southern California where Patricia—a listener of our Spanish broadcast, *A Través de la Biblia—*gives us her answer to that question.


*“I was scared and too lazy to read the Bible. But I thank God that your program has changed all of this. Through your studies and outlines, the Lord has awakened me to pray more and read the Holy Scriptures. Each day, I impatiently look forward to the program so that I can continue learning. I love you in Christ Jesus, and you are always in my prayers. May the Lord continue leading you and richly bless you as you take the gospel to the whole world.”*
Today let’s pray for the many listeners of our Spanish broadcasts in the United States and around the world. Like Patricia, let’s ask God to awaken their passion and desire to study His Word and know Him better.


**Tomorrow we’re headed North to Ontario, Canada … we hope you’ll join us.**
