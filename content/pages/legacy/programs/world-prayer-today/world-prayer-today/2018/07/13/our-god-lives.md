 “Our God lives …”


July 13, 2018




In northern Iraq not far from Irbil, God’s Word is quietly and regularly broadcasting in the Kurdish language.  


Please pray for Kurdish Christians today. *Thru the Bible* broadcasters report that there is great unrest in this area and a wide range of persecution of Christians is common.


And with our petitions today, let’s also praise God for the work He is doing in the lives of *Thru the Bible* listeners like this gentleman who wrote:


*“I thank the Lord for the blessing of this program, and its fruitfulness in our lives. Every morning you lead me into beautiful meditation and help me understand the Word, leading me in it throughout the day. Our God LIVES! And because of that we can face any difficult circumstance that comes our way.”*


**On Monday, we’re off to China. Come pray with us and invite a friend.**
