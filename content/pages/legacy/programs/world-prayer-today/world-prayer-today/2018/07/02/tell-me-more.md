 “Tell me more…”


July 02, 2018




Anywhere in the world that the Good News of Jesus Christ is shared, people will respond. For many, it’s like a drink of cool water in a desert. 


Such is the case in Belarus where our World Prayer Team visits today. 


Belarus is a small nation wedged between Poland and Russia. It’s only in the last couple decades that the gospel has been freely proclaimed here. This young man certainly appreciates hearing the Bible taught and prays for more. He writes, 


*“Good evening! Thank you very much for your programs about the Bible! I really like them! It is too bad that the good words of God can only be heard for 30 minutes. May the grace and love of our Lord and Savior bless you all richly. Can you tell me how to learn more from the good stories about Jesus Christ?"*


Continue to pray for *Thru the Bible* to be accessible to the people in Belarus who are eager to hear more about the Good News. Thank the Lord for His promise that His Word will accomplish all that God intends for it to do in our lives. 


**Tomorrow we continue our prayer tour of the Commonwealth of Independent States.**
