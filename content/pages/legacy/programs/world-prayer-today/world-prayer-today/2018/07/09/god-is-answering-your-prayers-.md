 “God is answering your prayers.”


July 09, 2018




*“God is answering your prayers!”* That’s the good news a young man named Sami in Egypt wrote to tell us.


*“‘For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.’ Thank you for sharing these words of life with me and for being my first and only source of spiritual food for so long. I was born into a prominent Muslim family in Sudan. One day I heard your Arabic broadcast quite by accident, but I knew it was the truth right away.* 


*“Once my family found out about my new faith, I was tortured. But I praise God my little brother helped me escape. I now live in Egypt and find it a privilege to share my faith with others I meet. Thank you for being my family when I had none, and please thank those who regularly pray and tell them that God is faithful to answer.”*


Yes, praise God, He answers prayers! And let’s continue to pray that the broadcasting of His Word will reach more Arabic listeners in Egypt, the Sudan, and throughout the world. 


**Tomorrow the World Prayer Team meets up with a university student in Istanbul, Turkey … please join us.**
