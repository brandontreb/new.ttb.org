 Back on the air in Japan


July 17, 2018




If you’ve been on the World Prayer Team for long, you know we’ve been praying for a new opportunity to go back on the air in Japanese after it was removed by secular programming. Japan is one of the world’s most challenging mission fields, and broadcasting Christian programs in a practical and effective way to Japanese speakers is only possible with God’s intervention. 


Recently, after years of praying for an open door to resume broadcasts to Japan, God answered our prayers above and beyond what we asked or imagined. TTB-Japanese now airs on eleven FM stations across the country, including one in the capital city of Tokyo.


Let’s continue to pray for the *Thru the Bible* program to have great effectiveness in the hearts of those in Japan, and also for those impacted by the many other new ministry initiatives around the globe. 


**Tomorrow we travel inland to the expansive nation of Mongolia. Pray with us!**
