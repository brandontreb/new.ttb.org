 Praying for our brothers and sisters in Yemen


September 24, 2018




Reverend Richard Halverson said, *“No place is closed to intercessory prayer. No continent—no nation—no organization—no city—no office. There is no power on earth that keeps intercession out.”*


That’s the hope we cling to today as our World Prayer Team travels to Yemen. Ranking in the top ten watch list for countries that persecute Christians, Yemen is one of the most difficult places to live as a Jesus-follower. Over 99% of the country practice Islam. 


We have no written correspondence from Yemen, but we know by testimony that despite the abductions, murders, and mistreatment of Christians, God’s Word is making a difference in the lives of those who love Him. Most believers in Jesus Christ are first-generation.


Please pray for the safety of our brothers and sisters in Christ and ask that through His Word, and the broadcast of *Thru the Bible,* that the Lord will increase their numbers and strengthen their faith. Through social media, Christian radio, and secret gatherings, the evangelical church in Yemen continues to grow, and more than ever before, people are turning to Jesus Christ, their only hope of salvation.


**Join us tomorrow as we travel to Iran and pray with a listener named Murad.**
