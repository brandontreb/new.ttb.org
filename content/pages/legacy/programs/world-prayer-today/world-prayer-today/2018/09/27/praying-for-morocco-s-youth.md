 Praying for Morocco’s youth


September 27, 2018




Known as the gateway to Africa, Morocco’s sparkling seas and ancient sandstone buildings attract more than 10 million travelers each year. But despite its romantic reputation, Morocco can be a difficult place to live.


Today we are interceding for almost half the population of Morocco who is under 29 and have limited access to education or jobs. 


Please join us in praying for the protection of children and young people who often seek emigration under very dangerous conditions. And please ask God to use *Thru the Bible’*s broadcasts in the languages of Kabyle and Arabic to bring hope to more young people like Jamil who recently wrote:


*“May the Lord who gave us life be glorified in your lives and may you carry on this wonderful, awesome ministry! You are the light in the midst of the darkness we live in. I once was without hope, but now I know God is surely with me. Keep shining so that everyone will know who Jesus is and will hear the Word of the Lord.”*


Isn’t that wonderful? Jamil is right, God *is* with us! As you pray, may you be reminded of that too.


**Join us tomorrow as we journey to Bahrain. And invite your friends to join us here at TTB.org/pray.**
