 “I was missing something … something important”


September 05, 2018




*“My name is Ajay.”* Meet a shopkeeper in a small village in Papua New Guinea. 


*“I have been a devout person, worshiping gods the way I was taught by my parents. I went on pilgrimages and made sure I appeased my gods. But if it weren’t for that constant gnawing within myself that made me feel I was missing something … something important, I would never have gotten to know about the real Lord and Savior.* 


*“One particular day, I felt depressed and wondered if the gods really saw my acts of hard work and penance that I did in their name. This constantly played on my mind, and I found myself getting distracted from work. The vicious cycle of depression, distraction, and unproductivity sucked me into a spiral, when one day a Christian came up to my store and asked me what was wrong. I didn’t answer, but he asked me the same question again the next day.*


*“When I told him what I was going through, he shared the gospel with me and gave me instructions to listen to your program. The producer, after a discussion on spiritual need, led me in a prayer to ask God for peace. Believe it or not, I found such amazing peace! God had given His own peace that He had promised. Soon enough, I accepted the Lord as my personal Savior. Now that I feel in connection with the real God and His peace, I continually want to learn from Him through your program. Thank you so much and thank those who pray for such as this.”*


Take this brother’s story to heart and keep on praying! 


**Tomorrow we travel on our knees to Myanmar.**
