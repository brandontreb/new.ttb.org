 “Would God ever take me back?”


September 04, 2018




*“Would God forgive and accept back a child who has turned his back on Him?”* a Filipino listener to *Thru the Bible* in the Ilocano language called and asked our program producer. 


He tells us more: 


*“‘Yes,’ I told him. ‘God is faithful and just to forgive us if we confess our sins,’ I added, quoting from the Scriptures. His next response wasn’t a question but an unexpected note of gratitude.*


*‘I am a child who has gone astray. I have turned my back on God and His ways,’ he said, ‘but after listening to your programs I now want to go back to Him.’ I told him that God would be really joyful if he did turn back to Him.* 


*“The prodigal son in Jesus’ story looked around his squalid living conditions and realized how far he had fallen from his status as heir. But our listener, who I learned is from Tabuk City and works night shifts at a 24-hour restaurant, sat down and listened to* [Thru the Bible *in the Ilocano language*] *and he heard God calling him home. And home is where he’s heading.”*


Praise God for this encouraging word. Pray now for more prodigals far from home—in the Philippines and in our own hometowns—to turn and head home. 


**Tomorrow we head south to mysterious Papua New Guinea.**
