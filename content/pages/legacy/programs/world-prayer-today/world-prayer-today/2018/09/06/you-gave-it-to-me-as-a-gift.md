 “You gave it to me as a gift”


September 06, 2018




When you pray for people you haven’t met, and that you will likely never know this side of heaven, you are giving them a gift. The gift of intercession. 


A listener in Myanmar—a country that has been hidden from the world for generations and from which the gospel has been hidden for even longer—recently wrote us a letter. Receive the gratitude: 


*“First of all, I praise God’s grace. He has given me the glad opportunity to live again in Christ and to receive spiritual strength from listening to your program. I have benefited much by listening to God’s Word which you gave me as a gift. I first learned from you First Thessalonians 5:16, ‘Always be joyful,’ verse 17 ‘Always keep on praying,’ verse 18 ‘No matter what happens, always be thankful, for this is God’s will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.’ I put these Scripture verses into practice. When I am alone I sing His praises and read my Bible. Please share always about God’s Word to me. My life has changed by filling it with God’s Word of truth because I have the opportunity to fellowship with God.”*


Thank you on behalf of listeners like this one in Myanmar for your faithful intercession. Keep praying for more listeners in places like Myanmar where the gospel is being heard for the first time. 


**Tomorrow we will pray through the exotic roads of Vietnam. Join us again in prayer.**
