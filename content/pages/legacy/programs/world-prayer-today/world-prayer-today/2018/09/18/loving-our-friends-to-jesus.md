 Loving our friends to Jesus


September 18, 2018




In the last two generations, faith in Jesus Christ has been a source of controversy in Russia. 


As the Iron Curtain lifted and the gospel was allowed in, albeit on a small scale, Russians became divided in how to respond. Today, the evangelical Christian population is about one percent. 


Pray today for the continued effectiveness of *Thru the Bible’s* outreach in Russia. Secular media makes it difficult to broadcast at times; pray for a continued open door to the good news of God’s love. 


This recent letter from a sister in Moscow paints a clear story of how to pray:


***“****The Word of God is changing me through your Bible studies. I came to know Christ six months ago, and I was full of joy! I began sharing the good news with all my friends. Perhaps I was too eager to tell them all about Jesus, but I never expected such a negative reaction. They basically stopped talking to me. The friendship that we had for many years just evaporated. When I listen to the* Thru the Bible *programs, I feel that I am home, that God loves me and will never leave me. Recently, I was sick and one of my friends did come to visit me. We had a good time, had some tea, and I invited her to come any time. Our friendship was rekindled. One day she came, and I was listening to the TTB program, and we listened together. I saw how God began to work in my friend’s heart. I now try to make sure I do not push her into making a decision. But I pray for her and all my friends every day. My friend is asking me questions about God, and I see that her heart is open for His love. Thank you, friends.”*


Lift up young believers in Russia, that their hearts would be encouraged and strengthened by God’s Word and the prayers of believers worldwide. 


**Join us tomorrow as we travel on our knees in prayer for the people of Tajikistan.**
