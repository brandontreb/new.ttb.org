 Praise God for a new perspective for life


November 19, 2018




In our daily prayer journey around the world, we’ve dedicated the last weeks of the year to pure praise for how God is at work in our lives and in the lives of those who seek Him in His Word. 


Today, we praise God with Tomorr, a sister from Albania. She writes, 


*“Some months ago, I accepted Jesus as my Savior. I didn’t know anything about the Bible. My daughters told me about your TTB program, and I am so thankful since it is helping me so much in my new life with Jesus. Since that first day, I am very blessed, since the speaker explains the Bible so I can understand. I have been so encouraged and do not want to miss even one program. I have so many things to learn. Thanks to the Lord, I now have a new perspective for life.”*


**Join us tomorrow as the celebration continues right here on World Prayer Today.**
