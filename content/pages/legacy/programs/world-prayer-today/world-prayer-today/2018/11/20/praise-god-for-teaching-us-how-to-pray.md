 Praise God for teaching us how to pray


November 20, 2018




What a privilege it is to pray together!


Lirie, a 72-year-old sister in Christ from Elbasan, Albania, writes with this wonderful reminder of how important it is to pray for one another:


*“I am a widow, living alone with my sister. I have three adult children, two of them living far away outside Albania. I am so blessed by your program which has helped me to better and better understand the Bible and my Savior, Christ Jesus. I also have learned by your example how to pray for my children and grandchildren. I am so happy God has chosen me. I ask for Him to choose them, too. Thank you for every touching and encouraging program you broadcast through your radio waves.”*


Praise God for the example of Jesus in teaching us how to pray for each other. As you pray for your loved ones to be drawn to Jesus, pray for others’ families as well. 


**In these last few weeks of the year, our prayer journey focuses in on stories of praise and celebration.** **Join us tomorrow as the celebration continues right here on World Prayer Today.**
