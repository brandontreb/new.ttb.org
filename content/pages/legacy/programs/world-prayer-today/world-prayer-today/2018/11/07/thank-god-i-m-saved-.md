 “Thank God I’m saved.”


November 07, 2018




*“Thank God I’m saved!”* 


Wherever you live, nothing compares to the joy and gratitude to God when you are confident that He has saved you from your sins and from hell. 


A grateful listener from Aveiro, Honduras, recently expressed his gratitude with this one word: 


*“Peace! That’s what I have in Jesus Christ. Thank God I’m saved. I praise God for the work Jesus did on the cross for me. I listen to the radio every day at work, because I’m alone in the office. It has been a source of companionship and blessing. May God continue to use you in my life and others’ lives. We desperately need His peace to blanket our country.”*


Thank God for the peace that He has brought to listeners in Honduras and ask that His peace will be experienced country-wide. Pray for others to proclaim like this grateful man: “Thank God, I’m saved!”


**We visit the beautiful and troubled island of Haiti tomorrow. Let’s join together again in prayer.**
