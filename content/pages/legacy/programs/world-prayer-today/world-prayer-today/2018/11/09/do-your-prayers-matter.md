 Do your prayers matter?


November 09, 2018




Ever wonder if your prayers make a difference in the lives of people around the world? 


Take to heart what Roberto from Baranquilla, Colombia, shares here: 


*“Dear brothers and sisters in the* Thru the Bible *family, it is my heart’s desire to greet you and thank you for such a blessing that has come into my life and the life of my family. Through listening, studying, and making the effort to put into practice the Word of God—that day after day and for many years you have given us through your prayer and sacrifice—I listen to* Thru the Bible *every day on HCJB, the Voice of the Andes broadcast from Quito, Ecuador. I appreciate your valuable material which helps me in the study and understanding of the Word of God.*”


Roberto reminds us of several important truths. God honors the prayers and gifts of His people to bring a spiritual harvest. And we must make the effort to put into practice what we learn from the Word of God, day by day. That’s a great dividend from our prayer investment today, don’t you think? 


**Next week our prayer journey around the world will take us to one of the most populous countries of the world.**
