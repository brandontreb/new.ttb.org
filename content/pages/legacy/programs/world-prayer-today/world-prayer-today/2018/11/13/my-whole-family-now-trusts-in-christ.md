 “My whole family now trusts in Christ”


November 13, 2018




*“Seeing the change in me … my whole family now trusts in Christ.”*


That’s the great news we receive today from a 14-year-old young man in Uttar Pradesh, India. Here’s the rest of his story.


*“I was an anxious child and became upset very easily. My parents were very worried about me as I became a teenager. When I first attended a Christian fellowship near our house my parents were upset, but they were surprised as I became very satisfied with life and became peaceful. Then when someone suggested I listen to your program in Hindi, our lives changed forever. I used to believe that only after taking a bath in the river Ganga could I receive redemption of sins! But you explained that Jesus has taken all our sins on the cross of Calvary by sacrificing Himself on the cross. Since then, I started believing in Jesus Christ and I have accepted Him as my Savior and Lord.”*


Amen! Today let’s pray for more people in Uttar Pradesh to hear God’s Word and choose to live in Him and for Him today. And let’s pray for Camil Bhuinya, the producer of *Thru the Bible’s* Hindi broadcasts. Ask God to protect and bless him as he reaches out in the name of Jesus.


**Our travels through India continue tomorrow in Andhra Pradesh. Join us here on World Prayer Today.**
