 Praise God that He meets us in our everyday lives


November 22, 2018




Our praise celebration continues here on World Prayer Today with a whole lot of great text messages from Armenia. Praise God for the way He works in our everyday lives. 


Enjoy these greetings from your brothers and sisters in Armenia: 


* *“Hello, my name is Karine. I am so happy you continue the radio programs. I deeply hope that people in my country will listen to the Word and accept Jesus in their hearts.”*
* *“Because of the truth and knowledge I get from you, I have learned to study the Bible and invited Jesus to change my life. I have learned to seek first His kingdom, to manage my time, and not to waste my heart on silly things.”*
* *“My name is Artyom. I am a hairdresser and it is so good I have an opportunity to listen to* Thru the Bible *at my workplace. My clients also listen every day and then we discuss the Word together.”*
* *“It has become my habit for me to turn on the radio every morning and listen to the Word. The programs give me inner peace during the whole day.”*
* *“I have always been living my life in a hurry, but your words make me stop and ponder. Now I see how empty life is. Without our Lord and His Word we are dead.”*
* *“I am praying for your ministry on your World Prayer Team. May our prayers have fruit in my country. I will be happy to learn that at least one person has repented owing to our prayer efforts and* Thru the Bible *program.”*


Can you identify with your brothers and sisters in Armenia? Praise God for His work there today.


**Join us tomorrow as the celebration continues right here on World Prayer Today.**
