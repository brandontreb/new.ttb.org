 Praise God that those who seek God, find God


November 21, 2018




Our praise celebration continues here on World Prayer Today with this fabulous letter from Murad (in an undisclosed country). Praise God that those who seek God find Him if they search with all their hearts. 


*“Your radio broadcast is one of a kind. From where I live, Christianity is vague and we do not have literature or books about it. Since my childhood I liked Issa Christ, but because no one could help me know Him, I tried to seek different means and ways. But then I found your program that talks about the truth that Issa taught. I’ve always wanted to have the Holy Bible, but I couldn’t find it in my country because it is forbidden. I was finally able to download it as a phone app, and now I can read it all the time. But I couldn’t have loved the Bible if not for your radio program! It is helping me to understand Issa and His gift.* Thru the Bible *is like a door to light for me, with all the teachings and explanations. I feel happy and not wanting each episode to end because it is like treasure! Many of those who are around me are listeners too, but they are hesitant to write because of the security issue. Thank you, thank you so much, and keep it up.”*


That’s right! And keep on praying and praising God that His Word will not return void—even in countries hostile to the gospel.


**Join us tomorrow as the praise celebration continues right here on World Prayer Today.**
