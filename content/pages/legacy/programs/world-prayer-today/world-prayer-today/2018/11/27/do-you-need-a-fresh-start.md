 Do you need a fresh start?


November 27, 2018




*“Behold, I make all things new.”* 


That’s the encouragement we receive from Beverly in Dayton, Ohio, here on World Prayer Today. She continues, 


*“When I heard this statement on your program, I realized immediately this message was for me … straight from the Lord. You have no way of knowing how timely this was, but God certainly does! I thank Him that through His grace we can start all over again … every day if we have to.”* 


Have you had a hard day, month, or year? Do you need a fresh start? Today as we celebrate God’s work in our lives and the lives of others around the world, let’s join Beverly in thanking God that He does indeed “make all things new” (Revelation 21:5). 


**Tomorrow our celebration brings us to Assam, India. Join us!**
