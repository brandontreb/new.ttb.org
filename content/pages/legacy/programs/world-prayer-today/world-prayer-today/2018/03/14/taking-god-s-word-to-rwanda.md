 Taking God’s Word to Rwanda


March 14, 2018




Today’s stop on our world prayer tour brings us to the country of Rwanda where one of our newer *Thru the Bible’s* productions in the Kinyarwanda language is going strong!


Spoken by more than ten million people throughout Africa, with the majority living in Rwanda, please pray that these Kinyarwanda broadcasts will bring God’s hope to a country that continues to heal from the brutal violence of the genocide in 1994.


Let’s also intercede today for the physical strength, spiritual discernment, and endurance of Parfait Mtamvutsa, *Thru the Bible’s* Kinyarwanda producer. Let’s ask God to use each message for His glory and to reveal His great love and grace to everyone who listens.


**Thank you for your prayers and your partnership! Join us tomorrow as we visit South Africa.**
