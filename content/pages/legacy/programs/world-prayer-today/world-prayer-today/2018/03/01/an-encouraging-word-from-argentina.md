## 
 An encouraging word from Argentina


March 01, 2018




*“Your words are a soothing balm as I work and complete my everyday tasks.”*


That’s the good word we received from a listener named Elena in Argentina. She continues, 


*“Your teaching is also very useful at the Bible school where I share your thoughts with my sisters in Christ. It is our hearts’ desire to grow in our knowledge, so we can share the Good News with everyone we meet.”*


Isn’t that great? Let’s lift up Elena and all young people in Argentina who faithfully study God’s Word. Let’s pray that His Spirit will guide their hearts and give them favor as they reach out with the gospel of Jesus Christ.


**Tomorrow the journey continues in Guatemala … meet us here and invite a friend!**
