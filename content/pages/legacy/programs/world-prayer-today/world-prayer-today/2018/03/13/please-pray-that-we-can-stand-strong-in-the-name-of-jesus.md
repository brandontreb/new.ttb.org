 “Please pray that we can stand strong in the name of Jesus”


March 13, 2018




Welcome to Nigeria where despite intense opposition and often violent persecution, God’s people are standing firm in their faith and are requesting our prayers. 


One listener recently called to say, 


*“Even though it’s so difficult for us to serve Christ our Lord in the northern part of this nation, your messages are a pillar of support and encouragement on how to stand by God at all times, no matter the situation. May God continue to bless you and the ministry. Please pray for us that we can stand strong in the name of Jesus.”*


Another listener texted this request, 


*“**I am a Muslim but God has arrested my soul to His Kingdom. Pray for me that I will not return to the Islam religion again despite threats from every angle.”*


And one young man recently shared, 


*“Pastor I have been listening to your messages. I want you to pray for me. I want to become a Christian but I am still finding it very difficult because of my family.”*


Today let’s honor these requests and pray that God brings strength, comfort, and peace to all of His people in Nigeria. Through them, may the name of Jesus be praised and upheld throughout the darkness of violence and unrest.


**Pray with us again tomorrow as our travels through Africa continue here on World Prayer Today.**
