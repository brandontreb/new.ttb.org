 Praise God for second chances


March 15, 2018




In Psalm 86:15, David praises God because He is “*full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering and abundant in mercy and truth.*”


Isn’t that a great picture of how God also relates to all of us? We received this letter from a listener in South Africa who writes:


*“I was saved about eleven years back, but through bad influence of my colleagues I began to make bad choices. I never went to church, but I also didn’t enjoy the life I was living. Then a friend told me about your program in my native language of Zulu, and so I tuned in. That day was the beginning of good things for me. Three months later now, I listen to your program almost daily and I have surrendered my life to God in true repentance. Thanks be to God who gave me a second chance.”*


Today, let’s praise God for second chances—for the compassion and grace He extends to us when we least deserve it. Whether we speak to Him in English or Zulu, let’s thank Him that He hears our hearts and welcomes us home.
