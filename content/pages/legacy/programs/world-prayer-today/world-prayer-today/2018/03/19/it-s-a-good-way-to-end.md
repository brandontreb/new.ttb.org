 “It’s a good way to end”


March 19, 2018




God’s Word says that *“precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints”* (Psalm 116:15). 


A ninety-year-old woman, Frau Gyuláné in Belgium, wrote recently that she and her husband have walked with God for their entire adult lives. As they near the end and their bodies begin to fail, they trust God even more. 


*“For years we have been listening to your programs—they are such a joy to us. We couldn’t say enough thanks that this ‘church service’ comes to our home. It is God’s blessing we share with others. Near the end, my husband lost his sight, and then most of his hearing. I sat with him in bed and sang to him and said good-bye that moment that his heart stopped. I was thankful because I was by him. I expect that the things I have learned will help me when my time comes. It’s a good way to end. I ask God’s blessing on your work so that lots of people become believers.”* 


Pray for others like this sister in Belgium who are facing the end of their lives. Ask God for faith and courage for them. Pray they sense the nearness of God and the joyful reunions that are to come. 


**Tomorrow we travel south to the countryside of France.**
