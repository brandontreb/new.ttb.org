 “I am such a sinner, and my Lord had mercy on me…”


March 26, 2018




We’ve got a lot to celebrate this week on World Prayer Today. 


As we count down to Resurrection Sunday, each day we’ll share the miraculous stories of God’s grace, meeting people who come to the cross of Jesus Christ and have chosen to believe. 


Today’s journey takes us to Colombia, where we meet with a young listener named Jose. 


*“I praise God for your* Thru the Bible *broadcasts. It was through you that I came to know salvation in Christ. I tuned to you by accident, in the jungles of Meta Colombia. It got my attention and I kept listening to you at night when I was able to pick you up on AM on the radio. I am such a sinner, and my Lord had mercy on me. I will continue praying that many people will be saved in the same way I was.”* 


Thanks be to God who has mercy on all of us! 


**The celebration continues tomorrow and all this week, join us!**
