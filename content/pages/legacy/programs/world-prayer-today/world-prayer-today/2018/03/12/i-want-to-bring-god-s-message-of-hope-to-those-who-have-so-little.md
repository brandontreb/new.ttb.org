 “I want to bring God’s message of hope to those who have so little …”


March 12, 2018




“*We receive your teachings with great joy,”* says one listener of *Thru the Bible’s* Shona language broadcasts in Zimbabwe. 


He continues, 


*“I am so happy that I can now preach from the Bible. I have grown so much from listening to your teachings and have become very active in church even when it comes to preaching. I am now better than before, and I am able to bring the message of hope to those in my country who have so very little and need so much.”*


Let’s stop now and pray for these great needs . . . both spiritual and physical. And let’s also pray for Clarkson Chidimura, our producer of the Shona language, as he shares God’s hope and love with those who desperately need it.
