 Keep on studying God’s Word!


March 02, 2018




Welcome to Guatemala, where God’s Word is encouraging Spanish-speaking listeners like Jose, who says:


*“As I listen to your broadcasts, I continually examine my heart to see if I am living the way God wants me to live. I look at my life through the lens of God’s Word, and the Holy Spirit helps me to continue studying. From a human standpoint, I tire easily and I often feel like quitting, but I realize that I need to study the Word day after day, and you help me to do that. I often pray that everyone listening will also have perseverance.”*


What a great prayer! Let’s join Jose in praying for all those who listen to *Thru the Bible* in Guatemala . . . and around the world. May God grant us perseverance and send His Spirit to challenge and change as we press on in our study of His Word!


And as we pray our way through Guatemala today, let’s not forget to lift up the producer of the Mam language, Gonzalo Ramirez Lopez, as he reaches out to the indigenous Mayan people with God’s love. 


**Join us next week as our world prayer journey continues in Asia.**
