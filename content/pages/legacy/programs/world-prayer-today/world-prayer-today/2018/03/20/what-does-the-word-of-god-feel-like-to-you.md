 What does the Word of God feel like to you?


March 20, 2018




The Bible is full of metaphors describing what God’s Word is like. Psalm 119:105 says that God’s Word is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. Jeremiah 15:16 describes God’s words as food that we eat and are satisfied. 


A listener in France describes God’s Word in another interesting way. He writes: 


*“My heart is full with thanksgiving because of the joy your broadcasts have given me in the recent times. The Word is preached, the gospel is proclaimed all around the world. What a big mercy it is. Having listened to your programme, I feel like a battery after charging.”* 


Isn’t that great?! If you’re feeling a little low energy today, get recharged with God’s Word! 


The truth is—as God’s Word goes out across the world, to some it smells like a sweet fragrance to them who are being saved as 2 Corinthians 2:14 tells us. And that same aroma smells like death to those who are rejecting God. 


Pray for those who are receiving the Word of God, that it becomes life to them as they believe. 


**We’re off to Monaco tomorrow. Get ready to pray!**
