## 
 A new medium, a faithful message to the U.K.


March 22, 2018




Today our prayer focus is on the United Kingdom—from England in the south to Scotland in the north. 


For many years, *Thru the Bible* has taken God’s Word to the United Kingdom using shortwave radio. In recent years, we added a regional Digital Audio Broadcast (DAB) ​network. DAB is like a digital radio station with more than 1,000 outlets broadcast in this format. People in the U.K. enjoy the world’s biggest digital radio network and its popularity continues to grow. 


Pray today for the people of Scotland, specifically, to discover the treasure of Bible-teaching available to them on this widely-used delivery system. Intercede for those who live in a culture that has experienced tremendous spiritual decline in recent generations. 


**Tomorrow we’ll travel on our knees to beautiful Sweden and pray for a new population there.**
