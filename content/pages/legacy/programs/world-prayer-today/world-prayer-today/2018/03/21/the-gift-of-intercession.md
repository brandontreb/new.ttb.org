 The gift of intercession


March 21, 2018




The gift of intercession goes both ways. When we intercede, we bring others’ needs before God’s throne. But even as we do this act of service, our hearts are strengthened, too. 


As we pray for people in a different country day after day on our world prayer tour, our faith and spiritual confidence grow, too. 


Today let’s pray for a country where very little or no spiritual fruit is visible. 


The country is Monaco on the Mediterranean coast of France. Monaco is roughly one square mile and with over 30 thousand people, it is the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world. Home to more millionaires per capita than any other nation, Monaco represents “the good life” to the world. Although Monacoians enjoy the freedom of worship, a sincere faith community is almost nonexistent. 


As a World Prayer Team today, let’s intercede for someone in Monaco to realize the answer to their life’s quest is found in Jesus Christ and for God to start a new work in their heart. Pray that an individual, a family, a community within this square mile would turn to Jesus as they are directed by the French broadcast of *Thru the Bible*, either online or on the radio. 


In Luke 15, when telling the story of the lost coin, Jesus let us in on a heavenly secret. He said, *“Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”* 


Let’s pray for this in Monaco. 


**Tomorrow we intercede for the British Isles. See you then.**
