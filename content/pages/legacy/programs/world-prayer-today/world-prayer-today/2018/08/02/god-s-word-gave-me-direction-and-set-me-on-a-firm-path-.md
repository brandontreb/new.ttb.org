 “God’s Word gave me direction and set me on a firm path.”


August 02, 2018




*“Hearing your broadcast was like coming home.”*


That’s how one *Thru the Bible* listener named Jorge from Bridgeport, Connecticut, began his letter to us. 


*“I confess that hearing you again after 20 years was an exciting moment. It was a joyful reunion and one of the best moments of my life—the same voice, the same song. Wow! As a teenager I listened to you from my home in Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. I learned so much from you. God’s Word gave me direction and set me on a firm path.* 



 *“Now as I listen 30 years later in Bridgeport, Connecticut, it seems like the distance and time have faded away. God is faithful! What a great gift He has given me! Thank you for faithfully broadcasting* A Través de la Biblia[*Thru the Bible’s* Spanish broadcast] *all these years and all over the world. I pray the Lord blesses you for your perseverance and uses each broadcast to instruct young men and women all over the world … just as it did for me so many years ago and continues to do today.”*


Yes, God is faithful! Let’s echo Jorge’s request today and thank God for the instruction we receive from His Word as well.


**Join us tomorrow as we hear the encouraging story of a prodigal son here on World Prayer Today.**
