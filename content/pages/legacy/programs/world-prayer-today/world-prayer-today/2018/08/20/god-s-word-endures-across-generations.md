 God’s Word endures across generations


August 20, 2018




*“Greetings from Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico (on the border with Texas),*” begins a letter from a man who has been a *Thru the Bible* student since he was a little boy. 


*“I’ve been listening to you on my iPhone since November 2012, and I follow you by downloading the podcasts to feed my spirit. Thanks to the Eternal One and to you, my soul delights listening to the study of His Holy Word, faithful and true. When I was a child, my mother would listen to you on KBNL in Laredo, TX. Now I am 35 years old, and it is incredible how this program has stayed in my heart. I belong to the generation that listened to you while growing up. Now I love the Lord Jesus Christ with all my soul and heart and will continue to ride the Bible Bus, inviting my children on board, too.”*


Praise the Lord for Christian heritages like this young man’s—and the dedication of parents to bring their children up in the Lord. Pray for young families across Mexico (and in our own hometowns) who want to raise their children to love God and His Word. 


**Tomorrow, join us here again as we head south to pray for Guatemala!**
