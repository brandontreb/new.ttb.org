 Albania: Traveling the long road to freedom


August 07, 2018




We’re traveling today on our world prayer journey to Albania—a country that suffered for decades under Communist rule. 


As you’d expect, it takes a long time to recover from the devastating effects of atheistic Communism. Albania used to be one of the hardest line Communist countries in the world, and today they have total religious freedom. However, more than 70% of the country has turned to Islam. 


Pray today for *Thru the Bible’s* Albanian broadcasts as we present God’s Word to millions of confused and lost people—some of whom are looking for the truth. Pray for people like Irena, who recently sent us this encouraging text:


*“I am 27 years old and have been saved for two years. Someone told me to come to church. But I have a lot of problems and didn’t think they would understand me. Then I discovered your radio programs. This is a great Bible study and I am so blessed to not have to go anywhere to listen to the program. I discover every day that Jesus is the answer to my needs. I want to learn more each new day from the Word of God, and your program is helping me to study the Bible. God bless you. Please pray someday I find a church to love me.”* 


**Tomorrow we’ll travel on our knees to another eastern European country and hear another invitation to pray.**
