 Raising teenagers?


August 17, 2018




*Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.  —*Proverbs 22:6


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we have the privilege of introducing you to a faithful family who listens to *Thru the Bible* from their home in Botswana, Africa. Many of you may quickly notice the resemblance they share with your family.


*“Your teachings are a precious treasure. We always value the time we sit and listen to your teachings. My family is growing in knowing Christ—even my teenagers! I feel humbled having them listening with me to your Bible teachings. It is my deepest desire that my children will hear your words and grow to serve the Lord as adults. May God bless the many families who are studying the Bible and who are praying the same prayer for their children.”*


What a wonderful prayer. Let’s join her in interceding for all the families who listen to *Thru the Bible*. May God’s Word penetrate their hearts and souls, and may He become the foundation of their young lives.


**Next week we’re traveling through Latin America. Join us, won’t you?**
