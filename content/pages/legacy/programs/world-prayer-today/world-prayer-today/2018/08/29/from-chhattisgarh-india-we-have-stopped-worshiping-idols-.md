 From Chhattisgarh, India: “We have stopped worshiping idols.”


August 29, 2018




Known to many as the “Heart of the Tribals,” the state of Chhattisgarh in India is filled with people who need our prayers. 


As one listener writes:


*“Please keep praying. Life can be so dark here. Many of us worship idols and live in sin. This is the way we have been taught by our parents who were taught by their parents … for many generations. But I praise God that He has changed all that. Your program has brought us joy, peace, and hope. My wife and I work in the field to support our three children. And when the day is done we listen to your messages and surrender our work and our lives into His mighty hands. Although it wasn’t easy, we have stopped worshiping idols and have begun trusting the Lord to lead and guide us in the days to come. Please keep broadcasting and pray that we might do our part to share Jesus with others so they can know Him too.”*


Yes! Let’s intercede for listeners of our Chhattisgarhi language broadcast who want to be a light for Jesus in their dark world. Ask God to fill them with boldness and wisdom as they share their lives. 


**Tomorrow our journey continues in Jharkhand.**
