 Truly, Christ transforms


August 16, 2018




*“Truly, Christ transforms.”*


That’s the message we hear today as our World Prayer Team meets with a listener in Mali who is eager to share His story.


*“I knew that I was an unbearable person because of my hard character. I shouted at everybody and insulted my wife in public, which often resulted in tears, but I didn’t care. One day I was so mean that when she asked me to listen to your program with her that night, I felt I could not refuse or she would leave me. As I listened to your words I felt a great sense of calm come over me. It was then that I began to feel remorse for my actions. Right then and there I gave my life to Christ and I thanked my wife for her patience with me. I give God the whole glory for my delivery and the restoration of my marriage, but I thank you for your faithfulness in sharing His Word for sinners like me. Truly, Christ transforms.”*


What a powerful message. It’s true! Christ can transform each one of us. Today let’s praise Him for the transforming work He’s doing in the lives of our brothers and sisters in Mali and all over the world. And let’s humble ourselves and ask Him to change our hearts, too.


**Tomorrow’s stop: Botswana. Join us right here.**
