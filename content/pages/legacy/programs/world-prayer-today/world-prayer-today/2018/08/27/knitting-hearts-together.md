 Knitting hearts together


August 27, 2018




In a northeastern state of India, a group of older ladies gather for an eternal purpose. This may make you smile: 


*“Often a dozen ladies come to my house every week with knitting needles and yarn. We sit in my living room and we knit together and talk about things of the Bible. We call ourselves the ‘Knitted Hat’ club. We gather for two reasons. 1.) We knit hats for poor people in Israel. We’ve been doing this for four years and hope to continue with that for a very long time. 2.) Why knit alone when we can encourage each other in the Lord? We often listen to your program and sing songs together. In my thoughts I hear Jesus saying. ‘What you have done for the least of these, you did for Me.’ We experience many blessings from your radio program—we learn so much from them! We would therefore like to kindly inquire whether the broadcasts will be repeated after the five year cycle is finished? We have been listening to the broadcasts for about 2 ½ years and would like to hear the rest of the Bible.”*


How encouraging to think of these wonderful ladies, with busy hands and full hearts. They intentionally fill their time with what will spiritually encourage each other. What a great model!


Pray today for this continued devotion to grow throughout India and any other place where women seek to serve others and honor God. 


**Tomorrow, we’ll continue to discover more faith in towns and cities of India.**
