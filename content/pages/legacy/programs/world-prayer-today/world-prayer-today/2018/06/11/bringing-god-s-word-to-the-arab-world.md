 Bringing God’s Word to the Arab world


June 11, 2018




*“Your teachings nourish and sustain my faith.”* 


That’s the good news we receive from one listener of *Thru the Bible’s* Arabic program. He goes on to say:


*“There are no churches in my area and it is unsafe to gather with other believers. I cannot tell you my name or where I live, but your words bring joy to my heart. The faith inherited from my family was never fulfilling, but through you I now know a Savior who answers all of my questions and brings peace to my soul. I pray that your programs will touch many lives in the Arab world. As much as I can I will tell others about you.”*  

This week as our world prayer journey travels through North Africa and the Middle East, let’s pray that God’s Word shines brightly in the darkness, illuminating a path for those who choose to follow Him. 


And let’s specifically pray for *Thru the Bible’s* Arabic program that airs in Oman. Ask God to expand our outreach and touch the hearts of Muslims who are searching for truth.


**Pray with us tomorrow as we travel to Libya.**
