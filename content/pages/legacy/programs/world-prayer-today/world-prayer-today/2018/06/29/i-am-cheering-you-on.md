 “I am cheering you on…”


June 29, 2018




“*While I strengthen my body, you strengthen my mind!”*


That’s what an encouraging listener from Ipsach, Switzerland, recently called to say. She continues, 


*“I have suffered from Parkinson’s disease for three years. Now while I do my daily therapy exercises, I listen to* Thru the Bible. *I want to thank you for your broadcasts which bring me so much joy! At the beginning of June 2013, I heard your program and was fascinated. You present the Bible in such a vivid and clear way. Sometimes I laugh out loud and sometimes I quietly reflect on what you have said. While listening to the programs I get new perspectives and many ‘a-ha’ moments! Please know that I am cheering you on each day and praising God for His glorious Word.”*


Today as we pray, thank God for the strength that His Word gives all of us. And let’s ask Him to bless the Italian and German broadcasts of *Thru the Bible* that are heard throughout Switzerland.
