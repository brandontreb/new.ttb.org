 Ask God to do a new thing


June 15, 2018




Isaiah 43:19 says, *“Behold, I will do a new thing, now it shall spring forth; shall you not know it? I will even make a road in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.”*


 


Welcome to Western Sahara. We’re glad you’ve joined us today as we ask God to do a new thing in a country where only a handful of Christians live among about 500,000 devotees of Islam.


 


 


As we pray, let’s ask God to open the doors for more Christian broadcasters and missionaries to share the name of Jesus with those who have never heard of Him. And let’s boldly pray for Him to bring forth national leaders to lead a spiritual awakening throughout this spiritually dry and deserted land.


 


 


**Next week our travels take us east to South Asia. Join us, won’t you?**
