 From India: God does it again!


June 18, 2018




Hebrews 4:12 says that God’s Word ispowerful … “a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” 


Every day, all around the world, God uses His Word to expose our spiritual need and then provide the answer. 


He did it again recently in India*:*


*“My name is Lalsing from Gujarat, and I have been listening to your program for the past year. Farming does not really support an alcohol addiction, and I wasted my life on liquor. I was suffering from depression, debt, and insomnia. A friend of mine introduced me to your radio program. When I tuned in, I heard that Jesus loves me, and it touched my heart. I began to listen every day, because it spoke to me and gave me peace. When the producer invited me to accept Christ into my life, I did. Ever since, I have been listening and growing in the Lord. Continue to pray for us here.”* 


Today, pray for others in India, as well as every other area of the world that the Lord brings to your mind, to respond to God’s Spirit at work through His Word. 


**Tomorrow, we’ll hear about a blind man in India who came to see Jesus.**
