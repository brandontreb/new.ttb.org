 Listening on the phone in Peru


June 05, 2018




Aren’t we all grateful for the opportunities that technology has made possible? 


Read this great story from a young father who is a small group leader in Peru:


*“Receive greetings from the whole family that God has given me, my wife and teenage sons. I have been listening to your program on my cell phone every day and am very grateful for the Notes & Outlines that you sent. The Lord has allowed me to teach a small group at our church, and the instruction that I receive complements this teaching. I pray for your ministry every day, that you will continue to grow and reach many homes in Peru for Christ. May God bless you richly.”*


We echo this young man and his prayer that more homes in Peru will be reached with the gospel. Just picture him listening to the same *Thru the Bible* message that we do—only in Spanish … and on his cell phone! 


**We travel farther on our knees into Latin America tomorrow when we visit the beautiful island of Puerto Rico.**
