 Small world—many opportunities


June 26, 2018




Today as we pray through Europe, we can smile to see how God uses technology and modern media to shrink the world. 


We’ll hear from several listeners today, all who listen to *Thru the Bible* in German—the first from India! 


A listener in India who listens to the German broadcast called to say: 


*“I am really pleased with my study of Scripture through the help of the* Thru the Bible *program. I can follow the storyline of the Bible very well. It is remarkable how God’s story ties history together.”*


Marta writes from Germany: 


“*I love* Thru the Bible*. I listen in the mornings and then in the night. Perhaps you can teach me what this mp3 is and then I could listen throughout the day.”*


And an email from Werter reads: 


*“My wife and I thank you very much for the interpretation of the book of Acts. The programs do us good, just as Jesus meant His Word to do. We write you in His name and His love.”*


Pray today that technology and modern media would take God’s Word to new and unexplored places. Intercede for those who are hearing the good news for the first time!


**Thank you for praying through the world—one country at a time. We’ll be praying again here tomorrow—b****e sure to join us!**
