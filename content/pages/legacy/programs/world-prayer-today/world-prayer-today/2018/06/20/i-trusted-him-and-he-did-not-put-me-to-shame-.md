 “I trusted Him and He did not put me to shame.”


June 20, 2018




  

We’re traveling through India today. Our sister Madhabi, a young widow, tells us her moving story: 


*“I am a new listener of the* Thru the Bible *Bengali program—just one year now. I belonged to another faith but I was wedded to a Christian boy. He brought me to church and read the Bible with me, but I was not very interested in knowing about God.* 


*“At 27, my husband was diagnosed with cancer, suffered, and died very soon. The entire burden of providing for my children and looking after my family came upon me. I worked very hard with little result. I also was harassed sexually by my employer. He spread rumors about me. I was in deep trouble and sorrow.* 


*“My neighbor introduced me to your program in January 2014 and assured me that God would give me victory over these problems in life. I started listening to the Word regularly and remembered how my husband loved Jesus. I cried to the Lord with a broken spirit. I cast my burdens unto Him and waited patiently for an answer.* 


*“I thank and praise God—after knowing Him, I trusted Him and He did not put me to shame. Now I love the Lord Jesus Christ, go to church regularly, teach my children about God, and continue to grow in the Lord. This program has helped me immensely. I am very happy. Thank you for your prayers.”* 


The World Prayer Team has often prayed for the people of India. What a great encouragement to see one life that the Lord has brought to Him since we’ve been praying together. 


**You’ll hear more of these encouraging stories from Pakistan when you join us tomorrow here on World Prayer Today.**
