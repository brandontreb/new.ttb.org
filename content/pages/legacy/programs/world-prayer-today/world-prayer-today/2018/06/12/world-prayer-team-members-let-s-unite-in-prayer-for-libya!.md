 World Prayer Team Members: Let’s unite in prayer for Libya!


June 12, 2018




Pastor and author A.T. Pierson once said, *“There has never been a spiritual awakening in any country or locality that did not begin in united prayer.”*


Thanks for joining us on this world prayer journey! Today our destination is the North African country of Libya where we ask you to join us in prayer for a spiritual awakening in this Muslim-dominant nation. 


According to the “2015 World Watch List for Persecuted Christians,” Libya is the most difficult place in North Africa for Christians to live. So let’s intercede for our brothers and sisters—both nationals and foreigners—who are experiencing violence and hostility. Let’s pray for their protection and for a change in the laws that forbid them to gather and worship together.


**Join us tomorrow as our prayers for North Africa and the Middle East continue as we visit the country of** **Mauritania.**
