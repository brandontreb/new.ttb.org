 “Islam may rule here, but we believe God reigns …”


June 13, 2018




Fasten your seatbelts, World Prayer Team. Today we travel to Mauritania, a country where our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ desperately need our prayers.


For those of you not familiar with Mauritania, it’s one of only four official Islamic republics in the world.


The constitution in Mauritania recognizes Islam as its only religion and Islamic Sharia law as the only official legislation. Because of harsh government restrictions, it is very difficult for Christian ministries, and Christians in general, to operate in the country.


In addition to being one of the world’s most spiritually needy countries, Mauritania is also one of the world’s poorest countries. One third of children face chronic malnutrition and many families struggle to afford basic necessities. Sadly, high rates of divorce also add to family instability. 


For these reasons and so many more, some believe terrorist groups gain support among local Mauritanians and are beginning to monitor Christian activity in the country. 


So World Prayer Team, we’ve got a big challenge—but our God is bigger! Although Islam’s laws may rule here, we know God still reigns. So together, let’s stand in prayer for the people of Mauritania. As we know, only God can change the hearts of the people who so desperately need Him. 


**Join us tomorrow as we’re off to Bethlehem.**
