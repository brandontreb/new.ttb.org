 Blind … but seeking no more


June 19, 2018




*“T**eachings about Jesus Christ weren’t new to me. I was born and raised in a Christian family. But it wasn’t until I lost my sight that I began to seek the Lord for myself.”* 


A man in India writes a common story—we think we’re doing fine without a Savior until a tragedy reveals our need. 


He goes on to say, 


“*Just when I thought all was lost, God sent a person into my life who reminded me about your program. I began listening to the* Thru the Bible *studies on the book of Deuteronomy. I repented for all those years where I never glorified God. I turned and saw the Lord, there all the time with His arms outstretched. I pleaded with my family to start actively studying God’s Word with me. Every day is an opportunity to thank God for the new knowledge gained through your program. I also ask Him each day to help me conduct my life in a way that His name may be glorified.”*


Pray today for those in the middle of something overwhelming. Ask God to use this need to introduce them to our Savior. 


**Our World Prayer Team journey continues in India tomorrow—traveling on our knees to a** **remote village in West Bengal****.**
