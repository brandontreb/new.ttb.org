 “Your prayer support keeps me going …”


June 25, 2018




*Bonjour,* welcome to France! Today on our world prayer journey we stop and pray for a listener named Mimose who contacts *Thru the Bible* regularly asking for our help.


She says,


*“Dear ones, again I contact you requesting your prayers for my family. Our difficulties continue and even though I am heartbroken, your support keeps me going. Thank you for letting me know that there are those who pray for your listeners all over the world. What a blessing it is to know that I am not alone. I want you to know that your messages in God’s Word are a lifeline not only to me, but also to others who are experiencing problems. May God bless you for your work.”*


Thank you for your committed prayer support of Mimose and all of our listeners, whether they live in Paris or Pennsylvania or anywhere in between. Today let’s pray that God’s Word bring us all closer to His heart and that each one of us will experience the peace and comfort only He can provide.


**Tomorrow we’re off to Germany. Want to invite a friend to join us on our World Prayer tour? Have them sign up here at TTB.org/pray.**
