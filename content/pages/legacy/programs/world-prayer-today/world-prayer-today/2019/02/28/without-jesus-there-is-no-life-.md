 “Without Jesus … there is no life.”


February 28, 2019




*“I have learned that without Jesus … there is no life.”* That’s what one listener in Argentina recently emailed to tell us. 


Her story continues:


*“I am so grateful that I found your beautiful website. Your messages teach me about the Bible and I understand it very clearly. As I have listened, I have learned to wait on God. May God bless and prosper you as you continue to bring so many believers closer to Him. As they listen, I pray they thirst more and more for His Word.”*


He’s right—the more you know about God’s Word, the more you realize how much you need it. Let’s pray that listeners in Argentina and all over the world realize their same need.


**Pack your bags; tomorrow our World Prayer Team heads to Guatemala. See you there.**
