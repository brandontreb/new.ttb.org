## 
 A fresh perspective from Poland


February 15, 2019




Do you need a fresh perspective? That’s what we’ll get today as we travel through Poland and meet this listener:


*“You have greatly encouraged me. Thank you very much. I can see that recently I have been looking at my problems from a rather earthly point of view. You have opened my eyes to a different way of looking at things. Through your gospel teaching, I am learning to trust Jesus more and more. I now read the Bible regularly, and I’m asking God to use my circumstances for His purposes. Please pray for me.”*


Isn’t that a great reminder? As Romans 8:28 says, “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.” 


So as we remember this listener in prayer today, let’s also ask God to help us trust Him with every circumstance in our lives, as well.
