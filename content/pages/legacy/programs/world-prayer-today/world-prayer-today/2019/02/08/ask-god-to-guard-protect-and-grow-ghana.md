 Ask God to guard, protect, and grow Ghana


February 08, 2019




No matter how mature you are in your relationship with Jesus Christ, we all return to several foundational ways we must trust Him. 


Although more than half of the people of Ghana profess Jesus Christ as their Savior, many struggle with leaving ungodly cultural traditions behind. Instead, they combine other religions with what the Bible teaches. This weakens their faith and leaves the church confused. 


Pray for the believers of Ghana to walk confidently into faith founded on solid ground. Pray that they receive with open hearts what they learn on *Thru the Bible*. Remember also to pray for spiritual protection of the Ghanaian church, especially in the north, against a strong Muslim presence that is making serious inroads into Ghana. 


Like many other parts of the world, Ghana’s current economic struggles make them especially receptive to the gospel. Intercede also for half the population that is under the age of 15, that they would be guarded from evil and spiritually open to the truth of God’s Word. 


A local pastor in Ghana recently wrote saying, 


*“Ghana ought to praise the Lord Almighty, for He has kept the nation as the apple of His eye and hidden us in the shadow of His wings. Intercede with me for my people and echo Deuteronomy 5:29, ‘O that Ghana would fear and keep His commands always so it might be well with her.’”*


We have good things to pray about today for the people of Ghana. Thank you for your faithful intercession. 


**Our prayer journey through Africa this week has been fruitful. Next week we’ll travel through Central Europe. See you then!**
