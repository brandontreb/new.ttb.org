 Heaven on earth—our prayer for Fiji


February 21, 2019




Fiji is close to 50 years old as a nation, after nearly a century under British rule. 


110 of Fiji’s 300 tropical islands are inhabited, with the majority of nearly a million people living on Viti Levu. That’s where Michael lives and from where he wrote us this letter:


*“It is by the grace of God that we have been led from before and after independence. I was a young boy at the time and remember my father quoting the Word of the Lord in Daniel 4:32b, ‘Until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He chooses,’ speaking of how God determines the affairs in the kingdom of men, and He alone appoints and dismisses rulers. Please pray for Fiji, that we continue to seek God’s will, and* *that He will guide those He has placed as leaders in our nation. Please pray that His Kingdom will come here in Fiji just as it is in heaven. It is on Him we fully depend because we cannot live without Him.”* 


While many vacationers think of Fiji as “heaven on earth,” let’s join with this godly man in asking for God’s will to be done in Fiji as it is in heaven. The same prayer can be said of all our countries and cities. Be bold in asking for God’s will to be done where you live.


**We’re off to another set of islands tomorrow—the fourth most populous nation in the world. Can you guess which one?**
