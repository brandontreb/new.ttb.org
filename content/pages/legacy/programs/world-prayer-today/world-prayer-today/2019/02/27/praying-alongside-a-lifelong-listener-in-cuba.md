 Praying alongside a lifelong listener in Cuba


February 27, 2019




Here’s a quick geography question for you. What islands make up the region of the West Indies?


If you guessed any of the following, you’d be right!


* Barbados
* Trinidad and Tobago
* Jamaica
* Saint Kitts
* Dominica
* The Cayman Islands
* TheLeeward andWindward Islands


As you likely guessed, the World Prayer Team is traveling through the West Indies today. Join us in praising God for the work He is doing in the lives of listeners like this one in Cuba:


*“I am a housewife and I love to listen to you. It all began when I was 8 years old and I would sit and listen to the radio station on a neighbor’s radio because we had no electricity. I thank you for the effort to transmit in Spanish. Thanks to you, I met the Lord in 1995. I thank God and you for being bearers of the Good News of salvation and I encourage you to continue. There are still many souls who need the Word of God. I pray you are effective in reaching them.”*


What a great request. Let’s join this sister and pray that God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* will change lives in the West Indies and around the world.


**Tomorrow we’re off to Argentina … join us there!**
