 Thank God for open doors in Senegal


February 06, 2019




The capital city of Senegal, Dakar, pokes out like an arrow into the Atlantic Ocean as the westernmost point of Africa. To wander the capital city’s streets and markets is a lesson in multicultural arts and traditions, as vibrant as it is diverse. 


Home to at least a dozen different ethnic groups, Senegal is not your typical African nation. It is a stable democracy that works to be a cultural and political bridge between Africa and other Muslim nations. They also pride themselves on ideals of acceptance—reaching across political platforms and extending religious freedom. 


Ninety percent of Senegalese people are Muslim, but the gospel is making inroads into this open nation. One short text from a Senegal listener sums it up, 


*“This is the first time I have heard such news of Jesus. Pray that I hear what is true.”* 


Pray today for an *open* door to the broadcast of *Thru the Bible* in Senegal. Pray for more Senegalese listeners like this one who reflects an *open* heart. Ask for continued favor for God’s Word to be heard through this strategic country’s *open* attitude. 


**Our mission to travel on our knees through every country of the world extends tomorrow to Angola. See you then.**
