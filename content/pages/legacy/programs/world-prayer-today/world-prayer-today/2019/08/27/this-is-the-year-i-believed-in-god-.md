 “This is the year I believed in God.”


August 27, 2019




*“For the first 40 years of my life, I lived in fear—fear of an unknown, hellish life I knew was waiting for me.”*


A brother in Karnataka, India, wrote this recently. He continues:


*“But this year, I heard the Good News of Jesus Christ on your program. Something in me told me that it was true. So, by faith, I believed Jesus Christ died for my sins and I was received whole before the Father. This is the year that I not only believed in God, but I believed this God loved me and gave His Son for me. Hallelujah!*


*“In the rest of my life, I will serve God faithfully and will faithfully study His Word through your program. I believe He hears us when we call His name. I wish many people will experience God’s goodness like me.”*


The next time you wonder if your prayer intercession for the people of the world makes any difference, remember this precious brother in India and believe, like he did, that God hears the prayers of His people. 


**We’ll journey to another area of India tomorrow and again witness God at work.**
