 “Thank you for helping me to survive.”


August 02, 2019




*“Thank you for helping me to survive.”*


That’s what Richard in Phoenix, Arizona, says about a particularly difficult time in his life. He continues:


*“I was in a tough relationship when Dr. McGee was talking on the power we have through our relationship with God. He went on to say we have power we haven’t even taken a hold of. That really struck me. His Word gave me what I needed to survive that very, very rough period. Thank you for helping me to find strength.”*


What a great letter. Let’s pray today for all those who need strength. Ask God to use His Word to give us clarity and power over the difficulties in our lives.


**Next week our world prayer journey takes us to Central Europe. We’ll see you there!**
