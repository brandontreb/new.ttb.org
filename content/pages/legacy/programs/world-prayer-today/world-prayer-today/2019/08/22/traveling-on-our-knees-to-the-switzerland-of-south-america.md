 Traveling on our knees to “the Switzerland of South America”


August 22, 2019




Uruguay is a beautiful place to live. In southeastern South America, nestled between Brazil and Argentina on the Atlantic Ocean, Uruguay enjoys warm temperatures, exquisite beaches, and a comfortable standard of living characteristic of their mix of Spanish and Italian culture. 


Yet in this beautiful land, less than five percent of the population knows Jesus as their Savior. One of our World Prayer Team members who has roots in Uruguay asked us to join her in praying for her country: 


*“We come before the only God Almighty, asking for His grace on our precious little nation. Through Your Holy Spirit, make Your light to shine in the darkness. Flood us with Your Word, especially in my city, Montevideo, that people would hear Your Word and lift their faces to heaven. We cry out to You for this people. Please shine on this land and bathe it with the light of Your salvation. Amen.”*


**Tomorrow we’ll travel north through rainforests and coastland to intercede for the people of Suriname.**
