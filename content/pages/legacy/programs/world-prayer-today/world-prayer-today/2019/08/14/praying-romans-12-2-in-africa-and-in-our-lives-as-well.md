 Praying Romans 12:2 in Africa and in our lives as well


August 14, 2019




Romans 12:2 says: *“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what**is**that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.**”*


And that’s the heart of a listener we visit today in Guinea Bissau, Africa. She says:


*“I am saved because I heard the Word of God in my language of Portuguese. I was confused and without a family and heard a Word of hope. Now I hear it every day in order to grow. I was confused because of religious talk … every church says something different. But your program talks about God, not about religion. I am so grateful. I pray every day that my mind and my heart would be renewed through God’s Word. I want to be found as acceptable to Him and only Him.”*


What a great prayer! Today, echo that prayer and ask that all listeners in Guinea Bissau would be renewed by God’s Word—and each one of us as well.


**Mali is our destination tomorrow. Join us as we pray with a local World Prayer Team member there.**
