 “After all these years, I found you…”


August 01, 2019




Welcome, World Prayer Team! Together, we stop and visit with Silvio, a listener of our Spanish language broadcast, *A Través de la Biblia*. 


He says,


“*After all these years, I found you!* *May God bless you. I am Guatemalan but now live in the USA. Many years ago I listened to you on Radio Cultural in Guatemala. Although I wasn’t a Christian, it caught my attention. Decades later, I have found Christ and my whole family is blessed by the program. I truly believe you have been placed by God on the earth to build up the church. I pray everyone would hear* Thru the Bible *and know God. Please keep broadcasting in Spanish here in the United States and around the world.”*


Let’s join Silvio in praying that more people will hear God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible*. And if you’d like to share our broadcasts with family or friends who speak, English, Spanish, or one of more than 100 other languages in which TTB is heard, visit [TTBinMyLanguage.com](http://www.TTBinMyLanguage.com).


**We’re in Phoenix, Arizona, tomorrow. Join us and bring a friend along for the ride.**
