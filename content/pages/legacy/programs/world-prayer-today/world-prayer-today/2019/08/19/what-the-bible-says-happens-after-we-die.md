 What the Bible says happens after we die


August 19, 2019




*“I live in the state of Puebla, south of Mexico City, and I want to tell you how my grandson introduced me to God through your program.”*


As you enjoy this sweet grandmother’s story, pray for others to also be delivered from spiritism and ancestor worship in Mexico and around the world. 


*“My grandson, Roberto, shocked me when he asked me questions about my altar for the Day of the Dead. ‘They are dead and cannot see how beautiful it is,’ he said. I believed that on the Day of the Dead, our dead loved ones come back to life to visit us and see beautiful things like this altar and taste their favorite foods. I wanted the dead to be happy, and that would make us happy, too. ‘That is not what the Bible says happens after we die,’ Roberto said.* 


*“I knew very little about what the Bible says, so I listened to Roberto. ‘How do you know?’ I asked him. And that’s when he introduced me to your program. I learned so much in such a short time. I realized I had been fearful of the dead for my whole life. I also learned that Jesus Christ took the stinger from death and He died for me so that death was not in control of my life any longer.*


*“Roberto and I listen every day to* Thru the Bible *and are learning so much. Thank you for this new life.”*


Praise God for the way His truth sets us free. 


**Tomorrow we journey to Guatemala to see how God is at work there. We’ll meet right here.**
