 The underground church is growing in Kuwait


January 16, 2019




*For the**Lord**is**good;* *His mercy is everlasting, and His truth endures to all generations.* –Psalm 100:5


Welcome to World Prayer Today. We’re praising God and asking Him to continue shining His light of truth on the country of Kuwait, where the underground church is rapidly increasing in size and maturity. 


Yet despite this growth, there is still much to pray about. While religious tolerance is significantly higher in Kuwait than other countries in this region, converts often face persecution from their families as well as police monitoring of their activities, arbitrary arrest and detention, physical and verbal abuse, legal discrimination, and property challenges in court.


So today let’s lift up our brave brothers and sisters who are willing to risk their well-being for their faith in Jesus Christ. Let’s also ask God to protect, encourage, and embolden them as they build His church to be a witness for generations to come.


**Our prayer journey through the Middle East continues tomorrow, join us won’t you?**
