 Pray for Palestinian Christians


January 17, 2019




Life for Palestinian Christians is downright difficult. Despite the fact that their roots trace back to pre-Islamic times, violence and extremism have forced many to flee their homes.


Yet some courageous believers are choosing to stay and stand for their faith. As one listener tells us,


*“Keep praying for us, we feel pressure on all sides. We need to know we aren’t alone. Please, brothers and sisters, we need you. Your programs give a great spiritual benefit to all listeners, including strengthening their faith. God’s Word gives us encouragement and courage to live this life of turmoil.”*


Isn’t that beautiful? Are you facing turmoil today, too? Let’s ask God to meet this listener—and all of us—in our areas of greatest need. And let’s ask a special blessing for those in the Palestinian Territories who boldly live for Christ despite the pressure and opposition that surrounds them.


**Join us tomorrow for our last stop in the Middle East this week in Algeria.**
