 Time to pray and praise with the World Prayer Team


January 28, 2019




Welcome to World Prayer Today. This week our journey brings us home to North America where we gather to pray with and for listeners across the United States and Canada. 


Today we enjoy the Southern hospitality of Susan, a listener from Georgia who joins us on the Bible Bus. Here’s her story:


*“I first heard* Thru the Bible *many years ago and would listen whenever I could, but I wasn’t a regular passenger on the Bible Bus. But now that I finally have a smartphone, I have discovered the mobile app and what a blessing it has been to me!* 


*“Now I get into my car to go to work and before I pull out of the driveway, I click listen on the daily broadcast and hop on the Bus! Dr. McGee rides along beside me, teaching me about the whole Word of God. I have learned so much in just a few weeks in the books of Jude and Haggai. Thank you so much for the tremendous blessing of this ministry!”*


Isn’t that great? Today let’s praise God for His ingenuity and creativity in helping us use technology for His glory. Let’s also ask Him to guide us as we seek to develop new ways to reach more people with His Word.


**Join us tomorrow as we take a quick trip north to visit John in Salt Spring, British Columbia.**
