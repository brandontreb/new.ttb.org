## 
 A light in a bleak world—pray for Mongolia


January 23, 2019




 Across the vast prairies of Asia, Mongolia has one of the smallest populations: Three million in the country, roughly the same number as those who live in the Cleveland, Ohio, metroplex.   

  

As a nation of deserts and pastures, Mongolia rests between the giants: China to the south and Russia to the north. Less than one hundred years ago, Mongolia was ruled by the Chinese. In 1921, it gained independence with Soviet support.   

  

But even in these hundred years, Mongolia has been unable to get its feet on the ground. Up against grueling weather and a struggling economy, social issues have taken over. Crime, alcoholism, and prostitution dominate the culture.   

  

But even in this bleak season, a light has broken through in the last 25 years or so. In 1990, only a handful of Mongolians knew the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior. Today, an estimated 40,000 are Christians.   

  

Pray for the godly leaders in Mongolia to know how to wisely tackle these tough social issues. Pray also for young families who, without any Christian family model, want to raise their children to love the Lord. Pray for *Thru the Bible’s* impact in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, where half of Mongolians live. Listener response has been great. Pray for Bat Tuvshintsengel (TTB’s producer) and his tireless team.   

  

Intercede with confidence today, knowing that your petition for this country where the church is less than a generation old will be heard and answered by the Lord.   

 **Tomorrow, our prayer journey takes us to a forbidden land.**
