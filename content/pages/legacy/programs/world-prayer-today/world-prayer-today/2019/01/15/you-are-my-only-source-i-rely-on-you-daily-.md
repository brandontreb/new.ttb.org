 “You are my only source … I rely on you daily.”


January 15, 2019




*“When my life goes through mountains and valleys, I cannot find refuge in anyone or anything but the Word of God.”* 


That’s what we hear today from a woman in Iraq. Her wisdom continues,


*“For my safety I cannot tell you my name or where I live, but I can tell you that the words you speak bring me life. Please do not stop broadcasting. I really want you to continue to help me in knowing the Lord and His Word. You are the only source I have … and I rely on you daily. Although I do not know any other believers, I know I am not alone. As you pierce the darkness in our world, your work will not be easy … but keep up the good fight. I am praying for you and I am praying many more Iraqis will hear God’s Word and accept Jesus Christ as their Lord.”*


What wonderful words of encouragement. Today let’s join this brave saint in praying God’s Word will change many hearts and lives throughout Iraq.


**Thank you for joining us in the privilege of prayer. The journey continues tomorrow as we pray for *Thru the Bible’s* Arabic language broadcasts in Kuwait.**
