## 
 One million university students in Taiwan need the Lord


January 25, 2019




Who would guess that one of the most challenging areas to share the Good News of Jesus Christ would be in the politically and religiously-free island of Taiwan? 


Formerly known as “Formosa,” Taiwan is a densely-populated island off the mainland coast of China now called the “Free Area of the Republic of China” (free of Communist rule). Yet that political fact stirs up frequent tension, even recently as Taiwan’s claim to independence has brought a military response from China. 


*Thru the Bible* is listened to online in Taiwan in both Mandarin and Cantonese where most people worship a unique blend of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. But the light is beginning to dawn. Here’s a response from one of the more than one million university students in Taiwan who are hungry for hope and meaning: 


*“Yours is my most favorite program online because it is most helpful. I feel touched and encouraged each day. I became Christian because of what you taught me about Jesus. After becoming a Christian, I have been internally changed a lot. For example, I respect my parents more. In addition, I do more good deeds and turn away from bad deeds while following God’s words. You have helped me follow God’s will better and walk into a bright future with Jesus.”*


Pray for more seeking college and university students to be open to the Good News and for the strengthening and growth of God’s church in Taiwan.
