 Do you remember when you accepted Christ?


January 30, 2019




Do you remember when and where you accepted Christ? For some of us, it may have been a long, long time ago. Let’s recapture some of that excitement as we share the story of a listener named, Cindy from Arkansas*.*


*“I am Honduran, but I live in the city of Sherwood, Arkansas. I accepted Christ as my Savior just a few months ago and since then I have been following your* Thru the Bible *studies. It is my great pleasure to tell you how much I have been helped by the studies along with the notes and outlines of each chapter of the Bible, especially the book of Genesis, because it helped me understand how it all started. Now I’m continuing in the book of Matthew.* 


*“You do not know how much I have thanked God for you. I remember you in my prayers so that you can continue helping all your listeners delve deeper into the Word of God in a clear and simple way and then to apply it to our daily walk.”*


Praise God that His Word is changing hearts in Sherwood, Arkansas, and around the world! Let’s join Cindy in praying that more people will dig deeper into God’s Word and apply it to their lives.
