 A “chance” meeting on a train


January 21, 2019




Want a snapshot of how to pray for God’s Word to be shared in China? 


Kwan, a Chinese businessman, shares this story of how God met him on a train: 


*“My heart has often been stirred to imagine that there was a greater story I had not heard before. I met a young woman on a train recently who shared in conversation with me about how she believes faith is* *more important than culture, that my identity is foremost in God, not in being Chinese or American or any other culture. This of course is different thinking than I had ever heard. I told her that a few years previously, someone had ‘coincidentally’ given me a copy of the Bible. I had read several chapters, but was left with many unanswered questions. She then explained more to me, ending with an invitation to listen to your program online. That night, I listened to several of your programs and understood more in just one hour than I have my entire life. I have since trusted in Jesus as my Savior and now live in Taiwan. God had plans greater than I could know that day on the train.”* 


Pray today for more “chance” meetings with followers of Jesus in China. 


**Join us tomorrow in praying for Japan.**
