 Praying for those in the “winter” of life


January 29, 2019




Thanks for joining us today as our World Prayer Team travels to Salt Spring Island in British Columbia, Canada.


Located between Vancouver Island and the British Columbia mainland, Salt Spring is known to many as the “Island of Tranquility,” and in recent years it has become a popular tourist destination for those who enjoy the arts and outdoors. 


Salt Spring Island is also home to more than 10,000 people including John, a *Thru the Bible* listener who recently wrote us:  

 *“Thank you for your ministry you have provided. I listen every day to Dr. McGee and I enjoy it so much. I’m in the winter of my life, can’t get around much now, so I love hearing the Word. Thank you for the broadcast; the Lord is so good to me.”*


Hearing from John reminds us of Ecclesiastes 3:1, *“To everything**there is**a season,* *a time for every purpose under heaven.”*


So, today let’s pray for listeners in Canada and around the world who, as John describes, are in “the winter” of their lives. Ask God to encourage and remind them of His love for them and purpose for this season in their lives.


**Tomorrow we’ll be praying alongside a listener of our Spanish broadcast in Sherwood, Arkansas. Invite a friend to join us by signing up here at TTB.org/pray.**
