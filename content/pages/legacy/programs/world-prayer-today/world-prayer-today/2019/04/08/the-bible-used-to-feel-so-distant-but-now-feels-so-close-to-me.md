 “The Bible used to feel so distant but now feels so close to me”


April 08, 2019




As the World Prayer Team travels through South Korea today, we’re joining some listeners in praising God for His goodness. 


Here’s a text we received from a listener in Seoul:


*“Whenever I listen to* *‘McGee’s Bible Study,’* *even the most difficult passages* *are* *so easy to understand. I am thankful that* *because of the* *study,* *I can enjoy reading the Bible. I am looking* *forward to it!* 


*“Just recently I started listening while driving with my family and my elementary school daughter has started to talk about what we are learning. What a joy! Our favorite thing is to talk about it. It is such a blessing* *to* *realize* *that God is* *a refuge and strength for* *everyone who relies on* *Him. Surprisingly my young daughter takes as much comfort in this as I do! Please keep broadcasting, we are listening.”*


And here is a great email from a listener named Risa who writes:


*“I* *am grateful that I can* *learn* *the* *Bible through* *‘McGee’s Bible Study.’* *I feel* *more* *strengthened* *every day by* *the* *in-depth* *explanation* *of God’s Word. I am amazed by the fact that the* *Bible, which seemed* *to* *be* *so* *distant, feels so close to me. I give thanks* *from the bottom of my heart* *to Pastor Kim and* *to* *those who make the* *program* *possible. I look forward to hearing* *the broadcast* *every* *day and praise God for His faithfulness in making His Word available across South Korea.”*


Yes! Let’s join Risa in praising God for His faithfulness and ask the Lord to multiply His Word in South Korea and around the world!


**Invite a friend and join us tomorrow as we travel to Mongolia.**
