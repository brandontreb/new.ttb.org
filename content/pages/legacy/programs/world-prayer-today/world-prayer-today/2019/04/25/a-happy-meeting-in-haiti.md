 A happy meeting in Haiti


April 25, 2019




Welcome to World Prayer Today. The *Thru the Bible* producer, Storly Michel, shares a glimpse into the lives of your brothers and sisters in Haiti who listen to our same Bible study lessons on the Creole broadcast: 


“*We were ministering in the coastal town of Phaeton recently and one man’s reaction was priceless. As I passed a one-roomed home in this town with no electricity, I noticed an old man, Ethius, who sat alone inside. He was listening to Radio 4VCEH on a solar radio that he’d just received from our team. He said, ‘I’m so very grateful for this new radio because my eyes are bad and I can’t read anymore, but thanks to you I can listen to the Bible now.’ When he learned my name, Ethius started to cry. Over the years, he’s listened to programs I present on* Thru the Bible*. He said, ‘Thank you, God, I’m so happy. God sent you to me today!’”*


Thank you, World Prayer Team, for partnering with us as together we serve God and the Haitian people through radio. 


**We’re off to Canada tomorrow, traveling on our knees.**
