 Praying for God’s Word to spread throughout Taiwan


April 10, 2019




The island nation of The Republic of China, more commonly known as Taiwan, is considered a thriving modern metropolis. But here in the hustle and bustle of economic and cultural growth, spiritual growth seems to be stunted.


The majority of the Taiwanese population follows a unique blend of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. And Christian growth has been slow, with only an estimated 6% of islanders claiming to follow Christ. 


That’s why your prayers are needed for *Thru the Bible* broadcasts in Mandarin and Cantonese. As one listener of our Mandarin broadcasts puts it:


*“Before the start of each broadcast, I pray first. I pray that the Lord will help me listen clearly, and also watch over the frequency during the broadcast time. Lastly I ask Him to bless others who are listening … maybe those who are lost and have never heard the program before. I pray that His Word is heard by many here in Taiwan.”*


What a great prayer! Let’s echo it today. Ask God to help each one of us listen clearly to His Word and then pray that others will be blessed, too, especially in Taiwan where so few know Him personally.
