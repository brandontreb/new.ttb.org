 Another way to “train up a child”


April 18, 2019




Welcome to World Prayer Today. If you’re a parent, you know the weight of Proverbs 22:6— *“Train up a child in the way he should go ….”* How can you do it, day after day?


Be encouraged today by Kelly’s story and how she is on the Bible Bus in Pennsylvania with her pre-teen girls:


*“**Teaching the Bible to my daughters (ages 11 and 13) has always been a challenge. I do my best, but often felt like the blind leading the blind. But now, every night we are on the Bible Bus together. I always struggled to read the Bible and understand it, as jumping around is so common. Without a thorough knowledge of how the pieces link, it gets overwhelming. Now I am happy my daughters are ‘getting it!’ They’re so interested, always asking questions, and being pre-teens, of course, they are not always satisfied with my answers. They have taken such an interest in studying Genesis and now Matthew with me, and look forward to working our way through Scripture each night. The blessings continue as the discussions can endure long into the evening. What a wonderful way to spend our time, bringing us together at the end of our busy days! Thank you so much! You have improved our life and helped us to further our connection to God the Father, strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ, and increase our hunger for the Holy Spirit. So many, many, thanks from me and my girls.”*


Praise the Lord that God’s Word is reaching the next generation and helping parents know how to “train up a child.” Pray for godly stories to be forming in young families you know. 


**Tomorrow we’ll celebrate another changed-life story—this time in India!**
