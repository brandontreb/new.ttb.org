## 
 Lord, capture the hearts of those who don’t yet know You


April 11, 2019




Thanks for joining us on World Prayer Today. Our journey brings us to the Land of the Rising Sun … also known as Japan.


It’s here in the beautiful mix of traditional and modern culture that we stop and ask the Lord to capture the hearts and the lives of a people who barely know Him. Most estimates confirm that less than 2% of Japan’s 127 million people know Him personally.


So please join us in praying for *Thru the Bible*’s Japanese broadcasts that can be heard on a small number of secular FM stations and on the Internet. Ask the Lord to multiply the opportunity to broadcast His Word and multiply the hearts that are willing to receive Him.


**Tomorrow we pray for listeners of our Cantonese broadcast in China. Hop aboard and join us!**
