 Praying for God’s special land and people


April 02, 2019




Jerusalem. Galilee. Haifa. Beersheba—Israel is the land of the Bible, where the story of God’s people began and ultimately where man’s story on earth will end. It’s a land and a people close to God’s heart. 


Yet in this important land, *Thru the Bible* is challenged with finding a Hebrew producer for the broadcast. Today, please commit fervent prayers that God would lead us to a translator and speaker who is trained and like-minded and who would be excited to join us in bringing God’s Word to the people who are the “apple of God’s eye.” 


We’ll keep you updated on the search. Please pray until a translator is found! 


**Tomorrow we hear from brothers and sisters in Christ in Jordan.**
