 Eavesdrop on phone messages from French Canada


April 23, 2019




As we pray through French-speaking Canada today, we’ll hear from listeners, not through letters, but through phone messages. 


Historically, this people group has been difficult to reach with the gospel. So rejoice over these encouraging responses to God’s Word taught in French. 


* A Muslim man living in Montreal called with questions related to Jesus as the Son of God. We asked a friend of the ministry, an elder in a local church and from a Muslim background, to get in touch. We heard back that they’ve had a good conversation by telephone and they are to meet again to talk more. The man is very open and has lots of questions about Christianity. His name is Karim.
* Another caller is a Catholic man who listens regularly to the programs and is fascinated with the Epistle to the Romans. Can we send him the Bible text? He says that the teacher goes too fast for him sometimes and he wants to take his time reading the verses to make sure he understands everything.
* A woman visiting from Paris called and said, *“I don’t know how to thank you for that incredible initiative and for all the work that you have done to make this five-year study possible! A colossal endeavor. Thank you for letting us download these resources for free! I will finally be able to better understand the Bible because of your explanations which allow us to uncover the hidden truths and a great many details. It gives a totally new dimension that in my view is worth being explored.”*
* And finally, a word from an enthusiastic Bible student in Quebec City: *“I just finished listening to the study on Zechariah and, frankly, I have to say that it is fantastic to have such a vision of the end times and the eternal glory of God. I am privileged to listen to the studies on my cell phone anywhere and whenever I feel like it.”*


Praise God for how He is working in French Canada! 


**Tomorrow we travel south to Florida and hear a great word from a fellow World Prayer Team member that will encourage you!**
