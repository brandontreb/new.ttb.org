 “I traveled around the world to find Jesus”


April 26, 2019




God is faithful to pursue His own. Celebrate how this man from India found Jesus: 


*“I’ve lived in British Columbia, Canada, for one year. I moved here with my employer. My original home is in India. A friend gave me a program guide and told me to tune into the* Thru the Bible *program. I was surprised how the Lord started speaking to me through Dr. McGee. I remember the day I was listening when God spoke to me through His Word (Hebrews 13:5, 6). The message touched my heart and all the fear inside me vanished. I had absolute peace. I couldn’t wait to learn more.* 


*“But then I moved and I could not find your broadcast again. One day in Canada, I passed an open car window in my employer’s parking lot and heard Dr. McGee’s familiar voice. My colleague shared with me your website and broadcast address. In due time, I came across a pastor who explained and answered all my questions on salvation, and I soon accepted Jesus as my personal Savior. I will always be indebted to* Thru the Bible *for introducing me to the hope of eternal life beginning in faraway India. I traveled around the world to find Jesus.”*


**Keep sharing the good news of Jesus Christ and taking the whole Word to the whole world. God is drawing men, women, and children to Himself all over the globe.**
