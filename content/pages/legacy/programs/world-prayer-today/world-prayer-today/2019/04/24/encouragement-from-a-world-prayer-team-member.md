 Encouragement from a World Prayer Team member


April 24, 2019




Here’s great encouragement from Carl—a listener in Keystone Heights, Florida—to those of you on the World Prayer Team:


*“I joined the team in 2014. Being a faithful team member has been a precious and transforming experience for me. I’ve always been the ‘loner’ type. This year, though, as I prayed in unity with my brothers and sisters for the people and countries brought before us each day, Jesus removed some inner scales from the eyes of my heart. My sense of ‘me’ one morning was replaced by a glorious sense of ‘we’ that I had never felt before. For the first time I was aware of my intimate connection with my other team members in Christ’s body. Further, my desire for God’s Word and Spirit to continue to go forth and bring many other people into Christ’s body, our body, leapt to life in me. Of course, I cried. I cried with joy for the ‘knowing I am growing’ into Jesus and deeper into unity with my brothers and sisters, as Jesus prayed in John 17:21. May ‘we’ have a memorable year praying together!”*
