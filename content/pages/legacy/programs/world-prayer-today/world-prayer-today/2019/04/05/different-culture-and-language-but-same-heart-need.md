 Different culture and language but same heart need


April 05, 2019




Today as we travel through the hot desert of Saudi Arabia, we bask in the shade of spiritual encouragement from dear brothers and sisters who are on the Arabic-speaking Bible Bus! 


Though their culture and language is different, their hearts reflect the same need for a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, taught in God’s Word. Meet and pray for your fellow Bible Bus riders: 


Jaffar writes, *“I met Jesus through your program a long time ago. I cannot imagine my life anymore without our time of study in God’s Word! I consider it my daily friend with whom I sit and from whom I learn the Word of God! May your program continue on air and may it tell the news of salvation to the hearts of many!”* 


Majdy tells us: *“Many thanks and warm wishes for your team of supportive friends and workers! The TTB Arabic radio program is one of the most effective, life-changing, and soul-growing programs! I am sure that many people are being transformed through their study of God’s Scriptures! May the Lord bless you and give you all the support you need to keep going and help you be a lighthouse for the lost!”* 


Their letters don’t reflect it, but these brothers and sisters are living in a difficult world, made even more difficult by their commitment to following Jesus. Pray for them today—that God would strengthen them for every challenge. 


**We’re back on Monday to fellowship with our family in South Korea. Join us!**
