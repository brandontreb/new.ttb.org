 Praying for the first generation church in Mongolia


April 09, 2019




*“Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete* *it* *until the day of Jesus Christ.” -*Philippians 1:6


Situated between Russia and China, the mostly barren country of Mongolia has been a spiritual wasteland for years. But since 1990, Christianity has begun to flourish and the church is growing. Even more impressive, this church that is less than a generation old is already sending missionaries to unreached areas of their nation!


So today let’s pray Philippians1:6 for *Thru the Bible*’s Mongolian producer, Bat Tuvshintsengel, and his team as they seek to educate a nation in biblical truth. Let’s also pray for the pastors and church leaders who desperately need education and who are tuning in to *Thru the Bible* for wisdom they can share with their congregations.
