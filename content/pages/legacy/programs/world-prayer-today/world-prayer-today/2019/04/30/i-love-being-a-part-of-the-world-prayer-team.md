 “I love being a part of the World Prayer Team…”


April 30, 2019




*“I love being a part of the World Prayer Team because it takes the focus off my little life and connects me to brothers and sisters around the world.”*


That’s what we hear from a listener named Deb in Boise, Idaho. She continues, 


*“I praise God that I live in a country where I am free to worship and have no fear of persecution. I pray for all to hear the words of the one true and living God, and I wait patiently for the day we will all celebrate together with our beloved Lord Jesus.”*


What a joy it is join with all of you faithful World Prayer Team members in praying God’s whole Word will reach the whole world! Let’s continue to intercede together and look forward to that glorious day when we’ll get to meet one another face to face!


**Join us tomorrow in North Carolina to pray for the Muslim world with David, another World Prayer Team member.**
