 “I await the results of my medical tests for cancer, but I choose joy.”


October 17, 2019




*“I await the results of my medical tests for cancer, but I choose joy.”* That’s the amazing encouragement we hear from a listener in Poland. 


He continues:


*“I have called you in the past, and I thank you for praying for me and my health. My greatest prayer is that God puts an end to bad things in me, so that I can become more like Jesus. Please, continue to pray because I am waiting for blood test results, including cancer markers. It is great to have such wonderful brothers and sisters who are there for me, who are praying for me and my health. May our Lord Jesus bless you and guard you against the evil in this world and grant you love and perseverance, so that you may continue to serve Him and many other people like me. As for me, regardless of the result, I will continue to follow the Lord and be grateful for His direction in my life.”*


What a great letter! Today, pray for those who are suffering from cancer and physical illness in Poland and all over the world. Ask God to heal and strengthen them as they focus on His Word and the comfort found in knowing Jesus Christ


**Tomorrow the World Prayer Team travels to Croatia. We hope you’ll hop aboard and join us.**
