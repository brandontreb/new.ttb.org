 Peace when afraid


October 29, 2019




In John 14:27 Jesus says, *“Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”*

Today’s World Prayer journey takes us to the Horn of Africa where we stop to pray for peace in Somalia, where Africa meets the Arab world. In recent years, the desperate plight of this strategically located nation has been all over international news. Ranked number two on the World Watch List for countries that persecute Christians, Somalia is a near impossible place to live for Jesus. 

*Thru the Bible’s* producer of the Somali language is concerned about the future of his country: *“We need meek and humble leaders who follow the Prince of Peace and the Creator of heaven and earth,”* he says, *“but violence and unrest is driving them away. Please ask God to intervene and bring us new leaders.”*

Yes, let’s agree in this prayer and ask God to bring Christian leaders to Somalia. 

**Join us tomorrow as our journey takes us to the Ivory Coast of Africa.**
