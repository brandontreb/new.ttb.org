 “I’m not yet a Christian, but I am drawn by this love . . .”


October 28, 2019




As the oldest independent nation in Africa and one of the oldest in the world, Ethiopia has a rich and distinct cultural heritage which includes a Christian heritage. 


More than half of Ethiopians consider themselves Christians. In the last decades, a strong Muslim influence has also been rooted in Ethiopian culture. 


Today on our World Prayer journey, pray for the gospel to continue to draw people to God. This email reflects a spiritual hunger that can only be satisfied in Jesus: 


*“I am writing to express my gratitude for your unique Christian radio program. I am not a Christian, but was amazed when I heard the story of Jesus (Isa) for the first time. The lesson was on love, the true love of Jesus Christ—the love that everyone should show to his friends! I didn’t expect this lesson to have such an impact on my life. Although I am not yet a Christian, I regularly listen to* Thru the Bible. *I discovered it while searching for another radio program. I don’t know why I found this radio program, but I am glad I did.”* 


Pray today for this seeker, as well as other listeners who “accidentally” discover the good news in Ethiopia and throughout the world. Offer your thanks to God that you discovered Him, too. Keep praying for the effectiveness of the gospel in your community and in theirs. 


**Pray with us tomorrow in Somalia.**
