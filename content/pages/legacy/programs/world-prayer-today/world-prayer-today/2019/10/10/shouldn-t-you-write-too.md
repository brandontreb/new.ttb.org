 Shouldn’t you write, too?


October 10, 2019




*“My name is Nevin and I live in the Naples, Florida, area. I am a part of your World Prayer Team and pray with you as I am directed.*


*“I sooo love hearing how* Thru the Bible *is taking the whole Word to the whole world. I thought today, if I enjoy hearing letters so much shouldn’t I also write a letter? Dr. McGee’s teaching has been my mainstay in a world gone crazy. Each month as I can, I send something to help with the Bible Bus. God bless this ministry as it remains faithful to get out the Word of God until Jesus comes. I’m praying on my knees with you through every country.”*


You are a valuable part of our ministry together, Nevin, and we’re glad to have you on the team. Keep praying. 


Nevin offers us a great example—shouldn’t you write, too? Share what this global prayer journey means to you. It’s great to hear from the team. Email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5b191219171e190e081b0f0f197534293c) and write in the subject line, “From the Prayer Team.” 


**Tomorrow our prayer team will travel on our knees to Mexico and the United States. Let’s be faithful to continue in prayer.**
