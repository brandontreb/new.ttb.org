 Praying 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 in China


October 04, 2019




Welcome, World Prayer Team! Thanks for traveling with us today to China where we receive encouragement from a listener of our Cantonese broadcasts who says:


*“When I became a Christian, I was going through a lot of difficulties. At that time, I had faith in God wholeheartedly. This led me to see (in surprise) how God brought me forward in the storms. In that moment, I was determined that I would believe in the Lord throughout my life, and to live to glorify God and bless others! As the years passed, my faith grew, but in the busyness of life I set aside my regular studies of His Word. Recently I have listened to your programs and my faith has been renewed. I realize I am guilty of needing the Lord in my weakness but not in my strength. Thank you for helping me to realize this arrogance and repent.”*


What a great reminder. First Thessalonians 5:16-18 reminds us to praise God in every season and give thanks that He is at work in our lives. Today let’s ask God to fill us with thanks and glory as we seek to follow Him.


**Next week our travels bring us home to North America. Join as we pray for our neighbors and friends.**
