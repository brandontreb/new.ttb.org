 “A beautiful interest has been born in me for God’s wonders”


October 11, 2019




*“A beautiful interest has been born in me for God’s wonders . . .”* Beautiful words from a lovely listener named Carla. 


“*About ten years ago my family started to listen to* Thru the Bible *on Radio Esperanza in Tamaulipas, Mexico.* 


*“I remember that at that time the Bible studies were aired at 5:30 in the morning. My family would get up early to hear the Word of God before going to school. This series of studies has been a great blessing to my life for these many years, because through them I have learned many things—things I used to ignore. But now a beautiful interest in knowing more and more about the wonders that God has given us in His Word has been born in me. Every time I remember you in prayer, I pray that God will continue to bless you abundantly so this ministry continues to help even more believers to be strengthened in the faith. I now live in El Paso, Texas, but listen online to* Thru the Bible *in Spanish.”*


Growing in faith is a beautiful thing. Pray for Spanish-speaking listeners in Mexico and the United States to hear and respond to the beautiful message of grace in God’s Word. 


**Our prayer journey next week takes us through central Europe—to people who are desperate to hear some good news. Let’s pray the way for them to hear.**
