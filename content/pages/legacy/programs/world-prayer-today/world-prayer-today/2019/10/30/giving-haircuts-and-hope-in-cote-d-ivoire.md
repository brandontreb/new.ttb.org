 Giving haircuts and hope in Cote d’Ivoire


October 30, 2019




Once recognized as a model of stability, Cote d’Ivoire is a nation that is now in near ruins. But despite political tensions and economic disaster, we rest in the knowledge that God is in control. 


That’s why today we’re praying for *Thru the Bible* broadcasts heard in African French. As one listener shares:


*“I am your faithful listener. I work as a hairdresser, and one day in my shop I came across your program and it changed my life completely. For the first time I understood what the purpose of my life is. From that day forward I have protected my heart by regularly listening to God’s Word. I also play your program for all of my clients who will listen. Many in my area do not know Jesus. I hope that when they leave my shop they not only have a new hairstyle, but a new Savior as well.”*


Isn’t that great?! Today, let’s boldly ask God to bless the lives of those who serve Him in Cote d’Ivoire. Pray that each man, woman, and child will hear of Jesus and turn to Him in faith and receive God’s gift of salvation. 


**Tomorrow we’ll travel on our knees to** **Mozambique. See you then.**
