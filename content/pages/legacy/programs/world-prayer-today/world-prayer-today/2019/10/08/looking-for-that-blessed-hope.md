 “Looking for that blessed hope”


October 08, 2019




*“I’m looking forward to that blessed hope*”—that’s what our prayer team member, Ruth, wrote to say. 


*“I have been on the Bible Bus since 1994 and on the prayer team since its beginning. I am impacted by the letters from people anywhere in the world whose lives are endangered or who have been ostracized by loved ones because of their faith and witness, and especially those who persevere in their faith, even when they are elderly or sick or who have so little materially that they are hard-pressed to find time or opportunity to study God’s Word with* Thru the Bible*. Yet they do.* 


*“I am constantly amazed and encouraged by the fact that God’s Word is so powerful and penetrating that it connects us who are enlightened by it; we have so much in common because of that one bond, even though we may be so diversified in our educational, social, and cultural backgrounds.*


*“I am so thankful to be part of a group faithful to the Lord’s command to ‘occupy till I come’ in praying for the lost to be reached with the name of Jesus Christ until the final one joins by faith and the Body is complete!”*


Thank you, Ruth, for that great encouragement. Let’s pray “for that final one” to come to faith in Jesus. 


**Come back and pray with us again tomorrow.**
