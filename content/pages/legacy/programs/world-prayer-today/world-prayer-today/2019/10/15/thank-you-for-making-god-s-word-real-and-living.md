 “Thank you for making God’s Word real and living…”


October 15, 2019




Welcome to Romania, World Prayer Team. As our journey through central Europe continues this week, we are realizing the power of God’s Word to change lives. 


Listen to the story we recently heard from Alexandru.


*“My family and I listen to you and rejoice in God’s Word. Your program is special because through your teachings we have discovered the truth of the Bible. Your broadcasts have been the main tool God has used to draw us to Him. We are thankful for the possibility to hear the Bible explained so clearly on the radio. We pray that the Holy Spirit will use this ministry to search the hearts of many. We pray for all of you who make this ministry possible. In our village there are also others that listen to the program. We talk sometimes about what we have heard. Thank you for making God’s Word real and living in our lives.”*


Isn’t that wonderful? Today let’s join Alexandru in praising God for the broadcasting of His Word both near and far! And pray that wherever God’s truth is heard more people will be drawn to His goodness and grace.


**Hop aboard as tomorrow we visit Serbia. Invite your friends to join us here at TTB.org/pray.**
