 Praying for one of the most restrictive countries in the world


July 04, 2019




*Blessed* *are* *those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,* *for they shall be filled.  -*Matthew 5:6


Hot and dry. That’s how many people describe the primarily waterless terrain of Turkmenistan. 


Thanks for joining us on this world prayer journey. Today we travel to what is widely considered one of the most restrictive countries in the world. With no freedom of press or information, it’s no wonder the country of Turkmenistan is infamous for the persecution of Christians.


Although the Turkmen constitution provides for freedom of religion, in reality only two belief systems are allowed: Sunni Islam and Russian Orthodoxy. All other groups are forbidden from meeting, and if they do meet they are subject to grave consequences.


That’s why some describe *Thru the Bible* broadcasts as an oasis in the desert. Today pray that more people in this inhospitable land will hear God’s Word and discover their deep hunger and thirst for righteousness. And while we are on our knees, let’s also remember our brothers and sisters who are persecuted for their faith. Ask God to be their comfort, their protector, and provide for their every need.


**Tomorrow the World Prayer Team is headed to Ukraine. We’ll see you there!**
