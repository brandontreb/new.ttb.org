 A father prays for his family in Vietnam


July 25, 2019




What do you do when your family walks away from God? You pray—like this father in Vietnam:


*“For many years now, my family has been blessed and encouraged by your program and our study of God’s holy Bible. We have three children: two boys and an oldest girl. My wife and boys all believed in God for more than ten years. But recently, our extended family put up many obstacles. My wife and two boys did not overcome them, and they have withdrawn from faith. However, I continue to listen out loud to the studies and their souls have been moved a bit. They have not yet come back to God, but I am praying. I pray God will use me as a tool for His works. Will you pray that for me and my family, too?”*


Yes, intercede for this faithful husband and dad to lead his family in the ways of the Lord. That’s a good request to remember as we visit every country on our worldwide prayer tour. 


**Tomorrow we travel to the middle of the Pacific Ocean to an island group whose motto is “Founded on God.” Meet you there.**
