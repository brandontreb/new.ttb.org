 From Vietnam, “My soul brims over with hopes in God”


July 22, 2019




Are you praying that the whole Word would go out to the whole world? Great! Then you’ll be encouraged by this word from a local pastor in Vietnam: 


*“I heard of your program when I was a student of Vietnamese Theological Institute in* *Ho Chi Minh**. I learned many things from the Bible lessons and from your website on Vietnamese TWR. It helped me in my training. Now I serve God in the countryside, so I can no longer access your website. But I have a radio and use it to follow God’s Word from the Old Testament to the New Testament and back again. I tell the people in my church how to listen, and it has become an indispensable need for those who are hungry to study God’s Word for themselves. Praise God! Thank you and God bless you all.”*


**We’ll pray in Southeast Asia again tomorrow—join us on your knees in Micronesia.**
