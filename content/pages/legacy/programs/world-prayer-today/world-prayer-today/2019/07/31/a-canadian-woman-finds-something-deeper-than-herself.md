 A Canadian woman finds “something deeper” than herself


July 31, 2019




*“I know there is something deeper … something more important than me.”*


That’s what we recently heard from Vi, a 26-year-old listener of our French programs in Canada. She continues:


*“My friends are only interested in fashion and going out to trendy places. I was continually surprised by their lack of interest in spiritual things. I was searching and kept thinking I was missing something.* 


*“When I heard your teaching for the first time, I was captivated. Then you talked about what Jesus accomplished through His death on the cross and it began to make sense. I called your offices, and one of your staff members spoke with me for a while and led me through a prayer of salvation. At that moment I was filled with such peace and joy. I will continue to listen and tell my friends and coworkers about your wonderful programs. I pray someday they will listen.”*


Let’s echo that prayer! As you come before the Father today, praise Him for this young woman’s faith and join her in praying others in French-speaking Canada will be drawn to Him through His Word. 


**Tomorrow we visit a listener of our Spanish language broadcasts in the United States. Hop aboard and join us!**
