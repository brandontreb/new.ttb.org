 The country where saying “Jesus” is punishable by death


July 18, 2019




Western and despicable. That’s what North Koreans are told about Christianity. But did you know this land was once affectionately called the “Jerusalem of the East?” 


But during the Korean War most Christians fled south, were murdered, or had their churches burned to silence them. Today, saying the name of “God” or “Jesus” in North Korea can be punishable by death, and reliable sources say more than 100,000 Christians are interned in labor camps. 


As we pray our way through this dark and mysterious country, ask God to lift the veil of secrecy and expose the persecution and human rights violations that have been covered up for so long. Let’s ask that His Word broadcasting out of South Korea will reach into the hearts of their oppressed neighbors to the North. As Jesus says in Matthew 19:26, *“With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.”* 


**Our World Prayer Journey continues tomorrow in Taiwan. We’ll see you there.**
