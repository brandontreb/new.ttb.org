 Pray for more broadcasting opportunities in Japan


July 16, 2019




Welcome back to Japan, prayer team! We’re glad you’re here as we continue to pray for *Thru the Bible’s* broadcasts that are heard on a small number of FM stations and the Internet. 


Most Japanese have blended Buddhism and Shintoism together to dictate the ritualistic practices of their lives. Interestingly though, over 80% claim no personal religion. So perhaps it’s not surprising that finding stations to air Christian broadcasts has often been difficult and unstable. 


So today, we ask you to continue to pray that God will expand the opportunities for us to share His Word and multiply the numbers of those who call upon His name. 


**Invite a friend and join us tomorrow as we visit the nomadic country of Mongolia.**
