 Praying for pastors in Canada


July 29, 2019




As our World Prayer Team touches down today in Saskatchewan, Canada, we are met by a fellow Bible Bus passenger named Robert who shares his story:


*“I am a retired pastor and am so thankful to God for the good teaching of Dr. McGee. Through the years, it has been a blessing. I was introduced to* Thru the Bible *over 40 years ago when a friend gave me some recordings to listen to. I lived for many years in Ontario and was able to listen regularly by radio, but now I listen online when I can.”*


Isn’t that great? As you may know, God’s Word is needed in Canada more than ever before! According to experts, over 100 years ago 25% of the population identified themselves as believers, but today less than 8% follow the Lord Jesus Christ. 


So as we pray, let’s give thanks for listeners like Robert and other pastors who faithfully share God’s Word in Canada. And let’s ask the Lord to increase *Thru the Bible*’s opportunity to reach more people with His living Word that changes lives.


**Our journey through North America continues all this week. Hop aboard and join us tomorrow as we pray alongside Ruth, an American listener of our Spanish language broadcasts.**
