 A great way to start the day


July 30, 2019




Welcome, prayer warrior!


*“I listen every morning at 5:30 before leaving for work, and my heart is filled with the daily teachings of each book, of each chapter, and of each verse. I pray everyone would start their day in such a great way!”*


That’s the encouragement we receive today from Ruth, a listener here in the United States of *Thru the Bible* in Spanish. She continues:


*“Through you I receive special blessings for my life and for my family as God feeds me with His Word. Thank you for having the heart to teach each one of us …. I pray more and more people will hear* A Través de la Biblia *and find joy and peace as they come to know God.”*


What a great prayer. Let’s join Ruth in praying for the wide reach and deep impact of *A Través de la Biblia* in the United States. May God use each broadcast to draw more people to Himself.


**Tomorrow we’re headed back north to Canada. We hope you’ll join us.**
