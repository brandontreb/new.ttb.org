 When life disappoints …


December 04, 2019




As our worldwide journey of prayer and praise continues today, we land in the Central European country of Romania where we meet with a listener named Arad who writes:


*“My life isn’t quite what I thought it would be. I was disappointed and disillusioned. I used to solve most of my needs by stealing, and I am now in jail. But it is here that I first heard your programs and learned about Jesus. It is also here that I was baptized. I believe the Lord has set me free from stealing and I do believe I have a new life. I am grateful for this new perspective and rejoice in having the time to study His Word. Please pray that His Word in my heart and in my head is what will make the difference in my life in jail and when I am released.”*


What a great story of redemption. Let’s pray today that His Word in Arad’s heart, and also in our own, is indeed what makes the difference in our lives regardless of where we are and what we are doing. 


**The celebration continues tomorrow in Kenya. Hop aboard!**
