 “I thank God that I’m far from where I was …”


December 26, 2019




Today on World Prayer Today, we celebrate the miraculous way God draws people to Himself. Like this brother in California:  


*“Dr. McGee brings a deep understanding of the Word of God that I have never experienced before. For many years, I watched the “Bible Bus” from afar but was always hesitant to climb on-board. Until a year ago when I found the Lord—or rather, when He found me. A co-worker met me at a local coffee shop and prayed with me. In that very parking lot, I acknowledged and confessed my sin and asked Jesus to be my Lord and Savior. But I didn’t feel any different. A week went by, no difference. A month, two, three months went by … no different. I did however continue to listen to* Thru the Bible *on my phone and read my Bible. Day by day, as Dr. McGee unwrapped the Word, I began to not only look forward to the next day’s message, but found myself* needing *the next day’s message! Over time, I changed. The change was not an instantaneous ‘flash’ but more of a methodical slow burn. Though I’m far from where I need to be … I thank God that I’m far from where I was! God called me and I answered. It’s that simple.”* 


Let’s thank the Lord for courageous people who share the name of Jesus with their friends, neighbors, and coworkers and one by one see them turn to God. 


**Join us tomorrow as the celebration continues right here on World Prayer Today.**
