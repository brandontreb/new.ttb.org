 Diverse but not disconnected


December 10, 2019




For many people, especially those who live in Africa and Asia, the gospel is not very old. Only in recent generations has the Good News about Jesus Christ been able to be told widely or openly. 


In fact, even now in some countries Bible teaching is still forbidden. But praise the Lord today that He is faithful to break through man-made barriers to share His Word and the hope of salvation through Jesus Christ. 


Ruth, a fellow prayer warrior in the U.S., encourages us to keep praying: 


*“I am constantly amazed and encouraged by the fact that God’s Word is so powerful and penetrating and how much it makes us all so connected when we are enlightened by it; we have so much in common because of that one bond, even though we may be diversified in our educational, social, and cultural backgrounds. I am so thankful to be part of a group faithful to the Lord’s command to ‘occupy till I come’ in praying for the lost to be reached for Jesus until the final one joins by faith and the Body is complete!”* 


**We’ll keep praying tomorrow right here on World Prayer Today.**
