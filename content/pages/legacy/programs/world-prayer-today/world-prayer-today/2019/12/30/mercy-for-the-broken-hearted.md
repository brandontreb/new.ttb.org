 Mercy for the broken-hearted


December 30, 2019




Thanks for joining us as we pray our way through cities, countries, and continents around the world. No matter where we go, we find people whose hearts are breaking. 


Today we visit with Jennifer, a grief-stricken mother in New York, who writes:


*“Thank you for blessing my life. My son committed suicide almost a year ago, and I often could not sleep because of the trauma and pain. My suffering was unbearable. God used Dr. McGee to comfort me when I would not be able to sleep, and let me know that God was with me.”*


Sadly, we know that Jennifer is not alone—each year more than one million people take their lives. Lift up broken-hearted families. Ask that they sense God’s presence in their lives (Psalm 34:18). Praise the Lord that He promises to be near to the broken-hearted.


**Tomorrow we’ll conclude our year-long prayer journey around the world. What will you remember?**
