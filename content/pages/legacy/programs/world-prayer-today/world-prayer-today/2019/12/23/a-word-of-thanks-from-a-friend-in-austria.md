 A word of thanks from a friend in Austria


December 23, 2019




If you’re a fan of the movie, *The Sound of Music*, you’ve experienced some of the beautiful sights and sounds of Austria and know a bit of its history. 


Thankfully, the sound of the gospel is also alive on Austria’s airwaves in German, reaching people like this friend from Salzburg (the same location as in movie): 


*“**Your program is really important to me; like a loved and faithful companion as I study the Bible. Thank you for coming to Austria.”* 


Today, pray that the life-giving message of Jesus Christ reaches the hearts of Austrian people. Very few people know Him as Savior, and a great spiritual emptiness covers this exquisite land. Ask the Lord to raise up Bible-believing pastors to be trained and serve in the spiritually barren places and for more people to hear and respond in faith to the God who loves them and longs for them to know Him. 


**Tomorrow our prayer travels take us on our knees south to Portugal.**
