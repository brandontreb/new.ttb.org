 Can I just say “thank you” …?


December 09, 2019




If you’re on the Bible Bus, then we’ve got a message for you from Juan in Orange, California: 


*“Can I say ‘thank you’ to all who are faithful in praying for and making this program possible? I am from Colombia but am living in Orange, CA. God permitted me to listen to your program on the radio one day on my way to work. I was so thankful to listen to a study that was in accord to what the Lord is teaching me through His Word in my short Christian life. It’s been now 2+ years on the Bible Bus. You have become the main source of the blessings God brings to my life, and I am thrilled to think this is happening with many more brethren right now all over the world. I now listen and financially support both the English and Spanish program through the app. I also want to say hello to all listeners and believers and thank them for their love for God’s Word and encourage them to live it out in the power of the Holy Spirit.”*


It’s a great day to say “thank you” to the Lord for how He draws us to Himself and grows us up in His Word. 


**The celebration continues tomorrow right here on World Prayer Today. Don’t miss the joy of God at work.**
