 Have you written yet?


December 31, 2019




As we mentioned last week, this year we traveled on our knees around the world, country to country. Thank you for your fellowship and faithfulness on the journey! 


Have you been thinking how God has used this effort in your life? Reflect on the following questions: 


* What country/story do you remember praying for this year? Any stand out?
* How did God use this prayer journey in your life? Do you see the world any differently?
* Why would you like to continue and encourage others to join you?


We’d love to hear your responses and share your encouragement with your fellow World Prayer Team. Just send your comments to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#33717a717f76716660736767711d5c4154) and we’ll get the word out. 


**Ready to start again next week? Our 2020 prayer journey around the world begins again right here on World Prayer Today.**
