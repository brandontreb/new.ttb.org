 “He has made an old man like me a new creature!”


December 19, 2019




*“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.”* -2 Corinthians 5:17


Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we are in Greece, praising God alongside a listener named George from Nicosia.


*“I have been listening to your programs for about a year and a half and am so grateful for each one. I thank God that He has saved me! Can you imagine? He has made an old man like me a new creature! If only I had heard you sooner I would have avoided so many mistakes in my life. My job ends at 9:30 pm**, the time that your programs start. I hurry to my car and I do not exit until your program finishes. It bothered my wife for so long, but now she listens, too. Recently when I listened to Exodus, I began to understand why the manna had to be gathered for one day only. We have to walk day by day. And so I will continue to listen to you day by day and receive exactly what I need from the Lord.”*


What an encouraging letter! Today, let’s praise God for how He feeds and leads us day by day. Like George, may our affection and joy for Him grow as we learn to trust in Jesus alone.


**Our prayer journey continues tomorrow, this time in Algeria.**
