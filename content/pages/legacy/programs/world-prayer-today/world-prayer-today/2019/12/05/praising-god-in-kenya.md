 Praising God in Kenya


December 05, 2019




Psalm 63:3, 4 says, *“Because Your lovingkindness* *i**s**better than life,* *my lips shall praise You. Thus I will bless You while I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.”*


Welcome to World Prayer Today. As our journey of praise and celebration continues this month, we stop and visit a listener in Kenya who tells us why this verse is important to her.


*“Jesus is Lord! I was saved after listening to your program. I was in darkness. One day when I turned on my radio I came across your program. After listening I gave my life to Jesus. God led me to a Christ-preaching church. I want to spend the rest of my life praising God … His love is what makes my life worthwhile, and I want nothing more than to share His goodness with everyone I meet.”*


Isn’t her enthusiasm contagious? Let’s praise God for the work He is doing in Kenya and throughout Africa. And while we’re at it, let’s praise Him for the work He is doing in our lives as well. Keep praying that more listeners will hear God’s Word and respond in faith!


**Meet us tomorrow in Ukraine as we continue to praise God on World Prayer Today.**
