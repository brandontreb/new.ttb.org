 You’re in good company


December 13, 2019




Every day that you ride the Bible Bus and hear stories from around the world, you join in a community of faith, committed to getting God’s Word out. 


Here’s a good word from Monty in Apple Valley, California:


*“I want to do my part with donations and with prayers to keep the Bible Bus running for many years to come. I’ve been on the Bible Bus for more than five years, and enjoy hearing the Word from Genesis to Revelation. I also love hearing the letters and testimonies of how God is using His Word in cities, towns, and villages in other countries. Sometimes it brings tears to my eyes to hear these testimonies, and how bad some of these country’s spiritual conditions are. But with God—we can do whatever He asks of us. 2 Corinthians 12:9, 10 says, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness … for when I am weak, then I am strong.’ Thanks to other prayer warriors on the team, we can encourage each other.”*


Be encouraged, World Prayer Team—and keep praying! 


**Join us next week for more praise and celebration.**
