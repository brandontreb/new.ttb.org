 Do you remember when God touched your heart?


December 06, 2019




*“I remember the day when the Lord touched my heart through your programs.”*


That’s the beginning of a beautiful letter from a listener in Ukraine. He continues,


*“I am so thankful to the Lord Jesus Christ for what He has done in my life. Especially for freeing me from false teachings. It was a miracle that He opened my eyes and I saw the truth. Last year Jesus gave me a wonderful wife, and this year a little son. We serve together in the church. Your programs bring the living Word of truth, and my wife and I listen to them. Through them the Lord strengthens us in our faith. We pray for you and ask that the Lord continues to use you to open the eyes of those who are deceived.”*


What a great request! Let’s join this listener in praising God for the truth found in His Word! Let’s also ask Him to use *Thru the Bible* to open the ears of others who are ready to hear it! 


**There’s more to celebrate next week on World Prayer Today. We look forward of praying and praising alongside you.**
