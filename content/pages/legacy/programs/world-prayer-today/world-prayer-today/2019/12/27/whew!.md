 Whew!


December 27, 2019




Whew! In 2019, we traveled on our knees around the world, country to country. Thank you for your fellowship and faithfulness on the journey! 


As we reflect on our worldwide prayer journey, consider the following questions: 


* What country/story do you remember praying for this year? Any stand out?
* How did God use this prayer journey in your life? Do you see the world any differently?
* Why would you like to continue and encourage others to join you?


Think about how God has used this effort in your life and share your responses with your fellow World Prayer Team. Send your comments and encouragement to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dd9f949f91989f888e9d89899ff3b2afba) and we’ll get the word out. 


**Our 2019 worldwide prayer journey is almost over. But don’t worry, next week we welcome a new year and a fresh itinerary for traveling the world on our knees. See you then!**
