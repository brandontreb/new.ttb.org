 A good story never gets old


December 16, 2019




Good stories never get old …. the prodigal son’s return … Saul on his way to Damascus … the thief on the cross—even when we choose the wrong path, God welcomes us home. 


Our prayer journey continues in California today where an ex-prisoner named Mike shares his powerful story:


*“My life was in ruins. I thank God He was willing to save me—even in Folsom State Prison. Every day behind bars was hard, but the highlight was to listen to* Thru the Bible*. I’ve been out of prison and out of trouble for 20 years now, and even today your broadcasts remind me of my first love, Jesus Christ.”*


Let’s intercede in this moment for all those who need freedom from their sin. Pray for their repentance and God’s restorative mercy to be at work in their lives.


**We’ll celebrate God at work again tomorrow right here on World Prayer Today.**
