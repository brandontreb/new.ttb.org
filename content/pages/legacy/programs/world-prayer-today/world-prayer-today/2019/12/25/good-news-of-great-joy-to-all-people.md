 Good news of great joy—to all people


December 25, 2019




As we celebrate this season of “good news of great joy which shall be to all people”—as the angels declared when they announced Jesus’ birth in that Bethlehem field—remember that they modeled how God’s grace would be shared with people from every country on earth. 


Today we’re thanking God for how He is at work around the world. One of our fellow prayer warriors writes,


*“**Tears flow when I hear of the hardships of people, my fellow Bible Bus riders in other areas of the world; but they turn to joy when I read about and pray for those who believe in Jesus Christ as Savior when they hear the Word of God on the radio. I am so very privileged to be able to pray for all. It is a commitment I have made and will continue to do as long as I am on earth.”*


Aren’t you glad for this privilege to intercede for people we’ll meet someday in heaven? Keep praying, Team. 


**Join us again tomorrow for another opportunity to pray.**
