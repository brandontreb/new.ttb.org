 Praying God’s Word reaches those who can’t read


May 24, 2019




In Psalm 33:8 God’s Word says, *“Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.”* 


Welcome to World Prayer Today where we’re traveling through the country of Benin, Africa, and hear from a listener who reminds us of this verse. He writes:


*“It is a joy to listen to your program. I was surprised to hear it in my language of Fongbe. Now I am able to get the love of God through His Word from my head to my heart. I don’t know how to read, but I know a lot of things about the Bible because of you. You have given me the fear of the Lord and I consider this a precious gift.”*


Isn’t it wonderful that in a country where one-third of the population lives in poverty and barely one-third is literate that God’s Word can be heard and is accessible to all? Let’s pray today more people in Benin, especially those who can’t read, will hear *Thru the Bible* and discover the hope and saving grace found only in our Lord Jesus.
