 “In the Bible I have found joy”


May 09, 2019




Jeremiah 15:16 says, *“Your words were found, and I ate them,* *and Your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; for I am called by Your name, O Lord God of hosts.”*


And that’s exactly what we hear today as we visit a listener named Liliana in Romania.


*“I have been looking for God for some time. I have listened to your programs in my car and the explanations are very helpful. In the Bible I have found joy that I never knew. I am a doctor and I would like to play this program for the patients in our hospital. Oftentimes the spirit needs as much healing as the body. May God bless you.”*


Today let’s praise God for listeners like Liliana and all those who have found joy in God’s Word and want to share it with others. And let’s pray that more hearts and minds will be open to God’s Word in Romania.


**Our prayer trek through Central Europe concludes tomorrow as we visit Czech Republic. Invite a friend to join us for the journey at [TTB.org/pray](http://www.TTB.org/pray).**
