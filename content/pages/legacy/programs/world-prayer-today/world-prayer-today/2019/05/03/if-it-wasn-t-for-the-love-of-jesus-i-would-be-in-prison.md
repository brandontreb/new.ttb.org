 “If it wasn’t for the love of Jesus, I would be in prison …”


May 03, 2019




*“I was addicted to using crack cocaine, and many other bad habits.”*


That’s what we hear from a listener named Mark as we travel through the great state of Tennessee. Listen to the rest of his miraculous story:


*“I am writing to express my joy and gratitude for the Bible Bus. I first encountered* Thru the Bible *about four or five years ago when I was going through a dark period of my life. I was addicted to using crack cocaine and had many other bad habits. But late at night I would sit wide awake and listen to Christian radio, trying to find answers on how to defeat this demon that had control of my life.* 


*“Each night at about 2 a.m. while I was phasing in and out of sleep, Dr. McGee’s voice came on and soothed me. His words inspired me because he taught the Bible. I had always been a believer but not faithful, and I never really understood what the Bible was saying.* 


*“Today, I am proud to say I am free of those chains of addiction, and my walk with Christ grows stronger each day. It really is true that His way is the only way. I have been to hell and back and have witnessed things no man should ever see. I should not be here today from all I have done. If it wasn’t for the love of Jesus, I would be in prison or even dead. He is always by my side, and I know I am not worthy of His love, but He still loves me, and I owe Him everything. So, thank you for starting me on a journey to seek Jesus and to learn who He truly is. This was the greatest gift I ever received.”*


Today, let’s praise God for His saving grace in all our lives and let’s pray for all those who are bound by the chains of addiction.
