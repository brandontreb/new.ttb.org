 From prison to the pastorate


May 02, 2019




*“It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.”* -John 6:63


Welcome to Orlando, Florida! Today we meet with a listener named Christopher who tells us how God’s Word gave him life.


*“I first discovered* Thru the Bible *when doing a Bible app search on Google Play. I came to Christ in 2011 while waiting in county jail to go to prison. I served an 18-month prison sentence. From age thirteen to twenty-five, I was a drug user and abuser. I was a known thief and drug dealer. Now my wife (who dealt with depression, suicide, and bullying for many years) and I are youth pastors at our church, and we met at Bible college. We are Spirit-filled and in love with the Lord and everything having to do with Him. I have learned more in-depth things about the Bible with Dr. McGee than anywhere else. TTB will always be my go-to Bible reference.”*


Today let’s pray for all those who are in prison—that they would find new life in Christ like Christopher. May they hear God’s Word and find the new gift God offers us through His Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ.
