 How to pray for the Philippines


May 30, 2019




As we continue our sweeping prayer tour through every major region and country of the world, we see a variety of spiritual needs. 


Here’s a small snapshot from recent texts from the Philippines on how to pray for and praise the Lord for His work there: 


* *“I have only recently hopped aboard the Bible Bus—having joined part way through our study of Daniel. What a marvelous program this is! Every day I feel uplifted and encouraged from my time in God’s Word. I have recently also joined the World Prayer Team as a means to support my Christian brothers and sisters around the globe.”*
* *“As I listen to this program, I feel as if I was sitting at school studying the Bible. Please pray for me. I want to be more and more transformed to be conformed to Christ.”*
* *“Greetings to you, servants of God. Thank you for this Bible teaching. I am a Christian; I recognize that Jesus did great wonders for me, but I am not satisfied with my conduct. Sometimes I fail to overcome trials and I walk in sin. Pray for me to be spiritually mature and to overcome.”*
* *“I am deeply touched by the Word of God on your teaching program. I have a big burden in my heart because I am a sinner. Please guide me and pray for me so that I could be a true Christian.”*


We’ve got a huge variety of ways to pray for our Filipino brothers and sisters. Just pick one that hits home and lift your intercession to the Father now.
