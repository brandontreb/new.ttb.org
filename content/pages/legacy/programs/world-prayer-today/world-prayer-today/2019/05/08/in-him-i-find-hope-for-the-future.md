 “In Him I find hope for the future…”


May 08, 2019




Shaped like a boomerang, the Republic of Croatia is known as the gateway to Eastern Europe. Today, as we stop alongside the sapphire blue waters and dramatic mountain peaks that dazzle so many first-time visitors, let’s take a moment to read some letters and praise God that His Word is taking root in the lives of our fellow Bible Bus passengers here.


A sister named Jadranka recently emailed to say:


*“Dear sisters and brothers in Christ! God’s blessing and may the Lord be with you! I want to thank you for the wonderful radio broadcasts which I always follow whenever possible. The broadcasts are full of hope and encouragement which are so necessary for us in these difficult times. Thank you and God bless you. It is a great desire of mine to own a Bible so that I can read and study and grow spiritually from it. I wish you God’s blessing!”*


And Boidar recently sent these greetings:


*“I listen to your Bible radio program regularly. I also listen on Saturdays and Sundays. I’d like the programs to be longer, if that is possible. I was in the Croatian Army the entire time of the Homeland War, after which I retired due to severely deteriorated health. Thank you for sharing God’s Word, in Him I find hope for the future.”*


Amen! Let’s pray more Croatians hear *Thru the Bible’s* broadcasts so they too can know the hope found only in Jesus. 


**Journey with us tomorrow to Romania; we’ll meet you right here.**
