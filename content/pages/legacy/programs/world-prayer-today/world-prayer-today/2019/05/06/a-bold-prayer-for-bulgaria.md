 A bold prayer for Bulgaria


May 06, 2019




Thanks for joining us on World Prayer Today. Our journey this week takes us through Central Europe where we have the privilege of praising God and praying with fellow Bible Bus passengers, including a young man from Bulgaria named Kostadin. 


He writes:


*“I was raised as an Orthodox, but my faith was never personal. So when I was old enough and left my parents, I started living as I wanted. I went through a really rough time. I had considered suicide several times because of broken relationships and mistakes I had made. That was the darkest time in my life. However, since October 2014 I have given my life over to Christ and began visiting the evangelical church with my friend. I’m grateful to say that I now believe that Jesus is my Lord and Savior. I am committed to changing my life. Thank you for your studies which have helped me grow in my relationship with God. Through your Bible teaching, my faith has become firm and I am sure of my salvation.”*


Kostadin isn’t alone. While it’s estimated that more than 80% of Bulgarians identify themselves as Orthodox, very few of them practice their faith. For many it is only a sign of identity. That’s why our TTB-Bulgarian team requests prayer for spiritual awakening in Bulgaria. Will you join them? As we pray, let’s thank the Lord for His saving grace in the lives of listeners, and let’s boldly ask Him to multiply their numbers with each broadcast that airs.


**Tomorrow our World Prayer Team heads north to Lithuania; we’ll meet you there.**
