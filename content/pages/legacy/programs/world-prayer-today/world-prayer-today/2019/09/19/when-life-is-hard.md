 When life is hard


September 19, 2019




*“Life is not easy at the moment.”*


That’s what we hear from a listener in Ukraine. Can you relate? If so, I hope you’ll receive encouragement as she continues her story:


*“Though life is hard, we pray for peace for our country Ukraine, and for the Lord to solve all our problems. Our factory is planning to reduce the staff, there are no more orders, and the payments are minimal. And so I find myself trusting in the Lord to help me carry on. I know that life is a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away. Therefore I would not like to murmur, but set myself on getting to know the will of God for myself. Thank you for your programs that remind me of what is really important. Today I will choose joy and constantly pray that the Lord will use this difficult time to draw me closer to Him.”*


What an amazing letter! Let’s pray more listeners will choose joy in the midst of hardship. May each one of us lean on Him and learn to trust Him with the details of our lives. 


**Our journey through the Commonwealth of Independent States and Russia concludes tomorrow in Uzbekistan. Come ready to intercede for our persecuted brothers and sisters.**
