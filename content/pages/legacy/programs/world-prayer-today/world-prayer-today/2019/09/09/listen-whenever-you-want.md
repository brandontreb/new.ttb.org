 Listen whenever you want


September 09, 2019




*“**I had forgotten how much I love the Bible ….”* 


For a million different reasons we all sometimes get distracted from our commitment to reading and studying God’s Word. Praise God, He faithfully pulls us back, giving us yet another opportunity. 


Ayshah, a listener from London, writes: 


*“I am a renewed listener to* Thru the Bible *since my nephew gave me his old iPhone just before Christmas. I first heard Dr. McGee many years ago, but the signal wasn’t good. Eventually gave up listening. I really liked his voice and way of teaching. I am so glad that now I can listen to your podcast whenever I want. Isn’t technology wonderful? I had forgotten how much I love the Bible—but more importantly, how much I love the Lord Jesus. It is a great encouragement during the week to hear of His love for us. I hope your program will always be there.”*


Yes, let’s continue to pray that *Thru the Bible* reaches more people with the timeless truths of God’s Word. 


**We journey through Western Europe all this week. Hop aboard and join us tomorrow as we visit Ireland on our knees.**
