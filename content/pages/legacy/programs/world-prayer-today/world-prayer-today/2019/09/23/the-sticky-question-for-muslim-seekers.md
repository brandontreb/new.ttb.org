 The sticky question for Muslim seekers


September 23, 2019




*“What do you mean by ‘He is the Son of God?’”—*that’s the sticky issue for many Muslim seekers. 


And that’s what Abdelrahim wrote to us about from Yemen: 


*“I’ve been listening to your program and would like to have your Holy Bible, because I couldn’t find it in my country. Your teaching seems interesting and what I hear about Issa* [Jesus] *seems different than what we were taught. Please what do you mean by ‘He is the Son of God?’”* 


Pray today for people from Muslim backgrounds who find their hearts stirred by the prospect of a loving Savior who is also the Son of God. Pray that they hear and respond to solid, biblical doctrine as taught on *Thru the Bible*. And pray with confidence, knowing that God’s Word says those who sincerely seek Him will find Him, if they search for Him with their whole hearts. 


**Continue on your knees with us tomorrow when we intercede for the people of Iran.**
