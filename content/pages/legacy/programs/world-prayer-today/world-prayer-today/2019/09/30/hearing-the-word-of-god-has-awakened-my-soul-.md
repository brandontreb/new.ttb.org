 “Hearing the Word of God has awakened my soul.”


September 30, 2019




Ephesians 5:14 says, *“Awake, you who sleep, arise from the dead, and Christ will give you light.”*


Welcome to South Korea. Today on our World Prayer journey we meet a listener who tells us that God’s Word woke him up. Here’s his story:


*“I was in a deep sleep, but hearing the Word of God awakened my soul. Through your teaching I can now meditate on the profound will of God every time I read even one verse. Sometimes I listen while I eat dinner, and I pray that I will live a life of thankfulness. Sometimes I sit and study and soak up each story, thought, and example. The more I read the Word, the more I am resolved to be the child that God wants me to be. I will continue listening to the program and loving His Word. It is my desire to serve Him until my last breath.”*


What wonderful encouragement. Let’s pray that God’s Word will awaken more people from their deep spiritual sleep. And like this listener, let’s devote ourselves to learning and loving God’s Word.


**Join us tomorrow as we head west and intercede for God’s people in Mongolia.**
