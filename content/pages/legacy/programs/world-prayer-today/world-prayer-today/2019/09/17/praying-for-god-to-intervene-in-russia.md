 Praying for God to intervene in Russia


September 17, 2019




Welcome back to Russia, World Prayer Team! We’re glad you’re here to pray for *Thru the Bible*’s ministry in the largest country on earth.


Not much has changed since a few years ago when the government began opposing broadcasting licenses for Christian ministries, but we continue to be reminded that God is in control and He still wants us to share His Word with millions of Russians. 


So please continue to intercede for God’s favor as we prayerfully build relationships in an effort to sustain traditional broadcasting on Russian radio stations, and pray for creativity and innovation as we consider new opportunities—including new mobile apps and satellite broadcasting. 


We are so grateful for your partnership and will be sure to keep you updated on any answers to prayer in this region. (In fact, we have a recent update to share. Look for it in our October ministry newsletter. Not on the mailing list? [Join today here.](https://ttb.org/resources/newsletter-archive)) 


**Join us tomorrow as we pray our way through Central Asia’s poorest country, Tajikistan.**
