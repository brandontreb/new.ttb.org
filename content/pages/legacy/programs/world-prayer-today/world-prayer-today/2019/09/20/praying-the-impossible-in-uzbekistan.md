 Praying the impossible in Uzbekistan


September 20, 2019




In Matthew 19:26, Jesus said, *“**With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”*


And that’s the hope we’re clinging to today as we visit the country of Uzbekistan. 


As we’ve mentioned before, there are only 25,000 known Christians in Uzbekistan (in a country of nearly 28 million) and they need our prayer. It is not uncommon for these brothers and sisters to face persecution, arrest, torture, and targeted attacks from government-controlled police and media.


Yet praise God that in spite of this harassment, the church continues to grow, mainly in urban areas, where about one-third of Uzbeks live. 


Today let’s pray for these brave saints and ask God to grant them freedom to worship without fear. And let’s boldly ask Him to bless *Thru the Bible’s* broadcasts heard in Uzbek and Russian. May the millions of Uzbek people be changed as they hear the name of Jesus.


**On Monday the World Prayer Team is traveling on our knees to Yemen. Invite a friend to join us and meet us there!**
