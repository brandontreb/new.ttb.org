 Good news from the Arab world


September 13, 2019




Have you heard the new things God is doing in the Arabic-speaking world? Believe it! 


Peek over our shoulder at the mail we’re receiving from a people group “who once were far off [but] have been brought near by the blood of Christ” (Ephesians 2:13).


From Thabet in Algeria: *“I’m a regular listener to the TTB program and I find it gives me spiritual nourishment, so it would be wonderful if I could have it on CDs so I can keep listening to it all the time! At home or in the car, all the time! May the Word that you broadcast open the hearts of many.”*


From Jaffar in Syria: *“I would like to express how your TTB program affects many lives, as I am a person who met Jesus through your program a long time ago. I cannot imagine my life without God’s Word anymore! I consider it my daily friend with whom I sit and from whom I learn of God! May your program continue on air and may it bring the good news of salvation to many hearts!”* 


From Majdy in Lebanon: *“I’ll start my letter with many thanks and warm wishes for your team! The TTB-Arabic radio program is one of the most effective life-changing and soul-growing programs! I am sure that many people are being transformed because of the relay of truth! May the Lord bless you and give you all the support you need to keep going and help you be a lighthouse for the lost!”* 


From Raed in Iraq: *“After many years of being lost in the world and in its sins, I’ve found you and found Jesus through your program! I am now His son and He’s my Father and Lord! I wanted to let you know that and also share with you that I cannot stop talking about Jesus Christ to whomever I meet! Pray for me to continue in God’s strength.”*


Want to be a part of what God is doing? Pray! Pray faithfully, with faith and excitement for all God is doing. Pray right now for these precious people and many more like them who are standing for God in a dark world. God hears your petition—pray now! 


**Join us next week to continue praying, this time for the people of Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States.**
