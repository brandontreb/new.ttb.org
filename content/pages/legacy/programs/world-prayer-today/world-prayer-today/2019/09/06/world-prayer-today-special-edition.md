 World Prayer Today: Special Edition


September 06, 2019




*“I have been praying for something like this for 16 years! Now our people can learn the Word of God systematically.”*


That’s what one pastor in Bangladesh recently shared.


Welcome to World Prayer Today. Our journey through South Asia ends early, as we make an unscheduled and exciting stop in a region of the world where God is moving mightily.


On today’s *Thru the Bible* broadcast, Gregg and Steve are talking about the doors God is opening in Bangladesh, and how you can specifically join us in prayer. [Listen here.](https://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/) 


And, as a special bonus, we also have a greeting and thank you message from Tapan Borman, the producer of our Home Group movement in Bangladesh. [Watch that message here.](https://youtu.be/QceoNwGsuKo)


As we pray today, let’s remember Tapan and all those who are following God’s lead and sharing His Word in amazing and innovative ways. Let’s also intercede for those in remote areas, especially those in lower castes in India who many consider “untouchable.” Though they are rejected by men, may they know how precious they are in the eyes of our Father. 


**Next week we’re headed to Western Europe. Grab a friend and join us!**
