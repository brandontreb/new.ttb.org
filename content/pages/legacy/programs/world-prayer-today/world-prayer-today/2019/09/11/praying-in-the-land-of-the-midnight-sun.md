 Praying in the Land of the Midnight Sun


September 11, 2019




Here are some things you may not know about Norway: 


Did you know that in recent years Norway has become one of the top missionary-sending nations in the world?


That said, even though the majority of people are church members, most are no longer committed to living by faith in Jesus Christ.


Also, Islam is now the second largest religion in Norway, with Muslims emigrating from places such as Pakistan and Iran. Many are not fully committed to the Islamic faith and are open to the gospel.


Today as we pray for the people of Norway, ask God to create a spiritual hunger and bring revival to the Norwegian church. Echo this prayer from a Norwegian sister for her homeland: 


*“Please turn our nation’s hearts back to You. Restore a fear of the Lord in Your church. Raise up Your people to stand in the gap for You. Forgive our pride and rebellion and break the spirit of empty religion. Bring revival to Norway. Make our people brave and adventurous so they would bring the gospel to our many distant places. Glorify Your name in Norway, Lord, and make us a blessing to other nations.”* 


**Tomorrow, the World Prayer Team travels on our knees to Wales. See you there.**
