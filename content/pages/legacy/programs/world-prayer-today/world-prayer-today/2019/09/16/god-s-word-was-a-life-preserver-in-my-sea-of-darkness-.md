 “God’s Word was a life preserver in my sea of darkness.”


September 16, 2019




*“It’s often in the most difficult moments of our lives that things become clear.”*


That’s what we hear today from a listener in Kazakhstan. She continues:


*“I faced several painful circumstances in my life and no longer found joy. I was lost and wanted to commit suicide, but I was afraid. It was then that I remembered a program I once heard and began a search for you. I decided to listen every day and, to my amazement, the words were clearer than ever before. I once was skeptical, but now it was as if God was speaking directly to me. I didn’t know it then, but my heart was crying out for God, and I’m so grateful He heard me and answered through you. God’s Word was a life preserver in my sea of darkness.”*


What a wonderful story of God’s faithfulness! Today let’s pray for all those who are lost in the seas of darkness and uncertainty. Let’s pray God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* is a life preserver for them as well.


**Join us tomorrow as we gather as a team and pray for ministry challenges in Russia.**
