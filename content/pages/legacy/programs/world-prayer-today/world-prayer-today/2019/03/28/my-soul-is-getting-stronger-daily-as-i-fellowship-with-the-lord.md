 “My soul is getting stronger daily as I fellowship with the Lord”


March 28, 2019




*“During the winter when the weather is bad and I cannot get out to fellowship with other believers, your broadcasts sustain and encourage me.”*


That’s what we hear from one listener in Russia on World Prayer Today. She continues, 


*“I love your programs, your kind familiar voices. My soul rejoices and praises the Lord. My heart is overflowing. Thank you for being my pastor, my church, and my mentor. I am not lonely because the Lord has brought you into my home.”*


And another listener recently wrote:


*“You are strengthening us elderly people. We cannot always be in church. But I sit every evening next to my radio and receive joy in Jesus Christ. I am 80 years old and my body is failing. Yet my soul is getting stronger daily as I fellowship with the Lord.”*


Isn’t that great? Let’s pray that as we fellowship with God through His Word, He strengthens us too. And let’s pray for *Thru the Bible* broadcasts to reach more people in Russia and around the world, bringing hope and strength into their lives.


**It’s a privilege to pray alongside you; join us tomorrow in Armenia.**
