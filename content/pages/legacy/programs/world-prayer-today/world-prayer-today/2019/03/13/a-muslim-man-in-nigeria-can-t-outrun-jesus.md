## 
 A Muslim man in Nigeria can’t outrun Jesus


March 13, 2019




*“I am a Muslim and this is my first day hearing your program.”* 


That’s what we heard from one listener of *Thru the Bible* in Nigeria. He continues,


*“Indeed I’m blessed through your message, and now I am interested in knowing more about what you call the Word of God, and what it takes to believe in Christ.”*


And another Nigerian listener texted this:


*“I have been fighting with Jesus for a while now. I don’t know where else to run, so I surrender my life into His hands. I come from a Muslim family and have been unkind to Christians in the past, but today listening to your program was a turning point for me and I am born again. Please continue to pray for me daily, I have determined I must follow Christ for the rest of my life. I am sorry indeed for my sins and ask God to forgive me.”*


Praise God! Today let’s pray for both of these gentlemen and all Muslims in Nigeria. May God’s Word pierce their hearts and bring them into relationship with Him. 


**Join us tomorrow as our prayer journey through Africa continues.**
