 Praying for a drug addict in Armenia


March 29, 2019




Freedom from sin. That’s what we’re praying for today as we visit with Garik, a listener of *Thru the Bible* in Armenia. 


Here’s his story.


*“I have serious problems and I want to ask you to pray for me. I am a drug addict, and I can’t give it up. When I am under the influence of drugs, I don’t understand what I am doing. I beat my wife and my parents. And I am even afraid that I might injure them. I really can’t give it up. The only thing I can do is to ask you to pray for me. Thank you.”*


Does Garik sound like a family member or friend you know? Today let’s pray for all those who are trapped in sin and are hopeless. Ask God to use His Word to rescue them from themselves and give them the strength to give their lives totally and completely to Him.


**Next week the World Prayer Team travels to the Middle East and North America. Hop aboard and join us!**
