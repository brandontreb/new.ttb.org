 Proclaiming God’s goodness in Kazakhstan


March 26, 2019




*“That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all Your wondrous works.”* -Psalm 26:7


Proclaiming God’s goodness! That’s our goal in Kazakhstan where *Thru the Bible* is heard in two languages, Uzbek and Russian.


Thanks for joining us on World Prayer Today where our travels bring us to this nation that stretches the vast expanse between Russia and China.


It is said by many that “to be Kazakh is to be Muslim,” with many people following a “folk Islam” that includes shamanistic practices. So today let’s pray the light of God’s Word breaks through the lies of Islam and allows God’s truth to shine in the hearts and homes of the Kazakh people. 


Let’s also pray for *Thru the Bible’s* producer of the Uzbek language broadcasts. For his protection, we can’t give you his name. But we can ask God to protect and bless him as he shares God’s Word in a very difficult part of the world.


**Join us tomorrow as our travels bring us to the rugged and beautiful country of Tajikistan.**
