 Bridging divides in Belgium


March 18, 2019




Today our World Prayer journey brings us to the divided country of Belgium, where God’s Word on *Thru the Bible* only reaches part of the population in French. 


Located between France and the Netherlands, there is a sharp divide in Belgium: One between the Dutch-speaking Flemings in the North and the French-speaking Walloons in the South. Some even believe that this may lead to the nation's separation. 


That’s why we are so excited to now have a Flemish language TTB program. Please join us in asking God to bless the production of each new broadcast and that His message of glory, grace, and reconciliation will bridge the divide that separates people and keeps them from embracing one another.


**And join us tomorrow as we pray that God will multiply His Word in the French language.**
