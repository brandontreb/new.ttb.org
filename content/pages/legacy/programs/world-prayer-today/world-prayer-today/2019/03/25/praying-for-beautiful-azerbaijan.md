 Praying for beautiful Azerbaijan


March 25, 2019




Welcome to World Prayer Today. Today we touch down in the picturesque city of Baku, Azerbaijan, on the Caspian Sea. 


Here are a few “did you know?” facts about Azerbaijan:


* 86% of the population is Muslim
* Most towns and villages have never heard about Jesus’ offer of salvation
* Strict regulations on religious institutions and foreigners legally prohibit the sharing of the gospel


That’s a lot to pray about! So, please join us in interceding for *Thru the Bible’s* Armenian broadcasts in Azerbaijan. Let’s ask God to use His Word to bring more people to Jesus.


**Join us tomorrow and invite a friend to travel with us as we head northeast to Kazakhstan.**
