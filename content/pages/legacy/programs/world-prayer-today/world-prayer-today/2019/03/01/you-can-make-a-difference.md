 You can make a difference


March 01, 2019




Nestled in the heart of Central America is the beautiful and troubled country of Guatemala. But despite the poverty, violence, drug trafficking, and political troubles, we hear very good news from listeners who live here. 


Listen to this story from Edgar:


*“I remember in 1974 when I was a kid, a family lived in front of my house and every evening they got out a speaker, put it in the hallway of their house, and they always put on the program* Thru the Bible *and played it outside.*  

  

*“Today, by the mercy of God, I am pastor of a church. Through your messages in Spanish, I am able to share the glory to God with those who need the hope and peace of Jesus. I encourage others to share God’s Word with those around them too. You can make a difference! Who knows where I would be without that neighbor who shared his speaker?!”*


Isn’t that great encouragement to share God’s Word with our neighbors, family, and friends? As Edgar says, *“You can make a difference!”* 


As we pray today, let’s ask God to bless us as we reach out in His name. And let’s also pray for *Thru the Bible’s* broadcast in the indigenous language of Mam. Ask God to touch the hearts of the more than half a million Mam-speaking people spread throughout the Guatemalan departments of Quetzaltenango, Huehuetenango, San Marcos, and Retalhuleu.


**Join us next week as we have the privilege of praying our way through South Asia.**
