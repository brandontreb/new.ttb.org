 “I know the truth when I hear it”


March 07, 2019




*“I know the truth when I hear it, and through your program we came to know the real God, His love, and power.”* Praise the Lord for this great news from a woman who was once controlled by demons. 


Here’s her story: 


*“My name is Dugiyan. I had committed myself to my religion, unaware it brought me great harm. I was in the stronghold of evil powers. It became so violent that my husband took me to witchcraft practitioners, hoping to rid me of the death-like control. But all in vain.* 


*“For days I suffered until my husband shared our plight with a friend from the market who is a Christian believer. When his friend came to our home and started praying for me, I became very violent, shouting loudly and trying to run out. But the prayer warriors defeated the evil powers of Satan and after much agony, the powers left me.* 


*“The next day, my new friend came again and found me relieved and shared with us the Word of God from John 3:16 and Romans 3:23. They also introduced us to the TTB radio program, and from that day onwards we have listened with much eagerness. I know the truth when I hear it, and through your program we came to know the real God, His love, and power.”*


What great evidence of the power of God’s Word that can break the chains of the enemy! Pray for people today who need freedom from evil powers—may God’s truth prevail.


**Join us tomorrow as we pray for prodigals and those who love them.**
