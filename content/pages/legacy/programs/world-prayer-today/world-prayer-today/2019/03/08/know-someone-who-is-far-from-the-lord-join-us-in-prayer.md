 Know someone who is far from the Lord? Join us in prayer


March 08, 2019




What does it take to turn around the life of a prodigal? 


If your heart has ever broken for someone you love who was running away from God, join us today in thanking God for His rescue of a teenager in India. A young woman named Vivek writes: 


*“My family loves Jesus and I grew up reading the Bible and praying. That is, until I went to junior college where I made new friends. Satan is very clever, and unknowingly I fell into his trap. My behavior and habits shamed me and my family.* 


*“One day I got into a fight with my parents and I moved in with my aunt and uncle. They loved me and tried to bring me back to the Lord Jesus without my notice. Every evening they sat and listened to your program. They didn’t force me to listen to the program, but I could not avoid it.* 


*“One evening ‘on the Bible Bus’ we were studying John 15, and God touched my heart. I learned about a life without God and I realized I was living that life. I repented of my sins and asked God to restore my life. Today I am a regular listener of your program. I am also an active member of my church. I praise God for the great change He brought in my life. Please remember me and other prodigals in your prayers.”*


Yes, let’s honor her request by interceding for those far from God—pray for them to turn back to God who loves them and waits with open arms. 


**Next week we’ll travel the roads of Africa—following God’s call to prayer for people seeking Him with all their hearts.**
