 “My evenings and mornings are transformed through God’s Word”


November 01, 2019




*“When things are difficult, I recite God’s Word and I am renewed**.”*


That’s the great news we hear today from a listener in Swaziland.  Here’s the rest of his story:


*“Thank you for your broadcasts. They are helping me discover not only where I stand with God but to understand the Bible better. I would like the notes that go along with your broadcasts. I do not read well, but I would like to try. I live in a rural area so it may take a while to receive them, but please try. Life is not always easy, but knowing God’s Word brings joy to my heart. I try to share this Good News with those I know. Please keep transmitting—m**y evenings and mornings are transformed through God’s Word.”*


As we pray today, let’s remember this listener and all those who listen to *Thru the Bible* in Swaziland and ask God to reach into more hearts and homes in this African nation.


**Next week we travel to Latin America. Invite a friend to pray with us by having them sign up here at [TTB.org/pray](http://www.TTB.org/pray).**
