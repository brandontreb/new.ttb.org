 “I come from a Muslim faith but have turned to Jesus.”


November 26, 2019




As we continue our celebration of how God changes our lives when we come to Him by faith, we stop today and visit with a listener of our Yoruba broadcast in Nigeria. 


He says:


*“I come from a Muslim faith but have turned to Jesus. I have no church that I attend because I cannot come out to say I am now a Christian, so I use this program to help me worship and grow. Please pray for me as I want to please God, but it is not safe to follow Him here.”*


Praise God for His Word that is reaching Nigerians despite the intense opposition to His name! Today let’s pray that His people stand firm and ask God to bless them for their faithful desire to walk with God. 


**Tomorrow we’ll celebrate another changed-life story—this time in Indonesia.**
