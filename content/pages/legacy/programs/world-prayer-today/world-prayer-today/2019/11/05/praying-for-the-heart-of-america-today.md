 Praying for the “heart of America” today


November 05, 2019




Often referred to as “Corazon de America” or “Heart of America,” Paraguay is our World Prayer Team’s destination today. 


At the center of South America, the people of Paraguay hear and respond to God as His Word is taking root in their hearts. Like this sister in Paraguay who wrote: 


*“Thank you for your programs. Listening to the Word of God has changed my life. You have introduced me to the God who gives me hope, and in Him I have found courage beyond my capabilities.”* 


Today let’s pray for all those who know and love the Lord Jesus in Paraguay. Intercede for those who are gripped by ritualistic religion and pray they are introduced to Jesus Christ. Ask for protection over local fellowships that teach the Word of God and whose members seek to live for God’s glory. 


And while we’re at it, let’s thank Him for His Word that gives us all courage and hope.


**Tomorrow we’ll continue our journey north to Central America. Join us in Honduras.**
