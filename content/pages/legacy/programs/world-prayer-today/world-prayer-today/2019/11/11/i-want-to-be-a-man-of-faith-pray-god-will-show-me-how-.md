 “I want to be a man of faith … pray God will show me how.”


November 11, 2019




Welcome to South Asia. Our journey begins as today we touch down in the country of Pakistan and meet with a mechanic who asks for prayer. 


*“I am a motorcycle mechanic by profession, and I found Jesus through your programs. I believe in Jesus as my Lord and Savior, however my family is strictly against me on this matter. Even my wife has disowned me. I am not welcomed in the house. They do not give me food and always start quarreling the moment I arrive. For the last year I have been living in my small workplace and managing on my own. God has been using your broadcast to strengthen and console me. And lately He has been using me for His work, especially through prayer. Please pray my family members and my wife may also know the truth and that we may be reconciled. I want to be a man of faith and character, please pray God will show me how.”*


What a great request. Let’s remember this young man and those waiting on friends and loved ones to be saved. May God encourage our hearts as we patiently wait for Him to answer these prayers.


**Travel in prayer with us tomorrow to Uttar Pradesh, India.**
