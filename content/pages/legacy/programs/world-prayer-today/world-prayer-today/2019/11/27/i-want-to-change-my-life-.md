 “I want to change my life.”


November 27, 2019




Welcome, World Prayer Team! Today we travel to Indonesia to meet a listener of our Javanese program who recently gave his life to Jesus. 


Listen to this wonderful story.


*“My family is poor and we often feel vulnerable, as if no one cares for us. After hearing your program, I felt God’s love and received Jesus. As my family listened with me, they also began to feel peace and God’s protection. It has only been a month, but we have all given our lives to Him. Now as I listen, I want to change our lives. I want to know what God requires and do only those things. Please pray for me and my family, we wish to serve Him well.”*


Praise the Lord that God’s Word is reaching families in the Muslim-dominant nation of Indonesia! Pray that more people will hear and believe the good news God has for them.


**Join us tomorrow for more praise and celebration on World Prayer Today.**
