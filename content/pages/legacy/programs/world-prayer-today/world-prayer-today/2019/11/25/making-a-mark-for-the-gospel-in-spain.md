 Making a mark for the gospel in Spain


November 25, 2019




*“A few days ago, I began listening to your program,”* Marco from Torre del Mar, Spain, told us. 


***“I****have to admit,”* he said*, “hearing the Bible has made a great impact on me. I’m so moved by it that I dared even to phone you. Could I ask for the Gospel of John you shared, please? I have never read the Bible and would love to do it for the first time. Thank you for this good work. It is making its mark on me.*”


Your prayers are having an impact in the sharing of the Good News of Jesus Christ in Spain! Encourage each other to keep interceding for people like Marco who are hearing for the very first time how they can know God. 


**God is doing great things around the world. We’ll continue our celebration through the coming weeks.**
