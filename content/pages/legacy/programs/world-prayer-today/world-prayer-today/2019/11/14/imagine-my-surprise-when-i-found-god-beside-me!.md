 “Imagine my surprise when I found God … beside me!”


November 14, 2019




Everyone’s story of how they came to faith is unique, but we all share the same beginning: We once were lost … and then we were found. 


Enjoy this young man’s brief but beautiful account of coming to faith in Jesus Christ. This brother writes from Tripura, India: 


*“My youth was spent carelessly, but as I grew older I began to ask many serious questions and began searching for the truth. A friend suggested I listen to your program, and imagine my surprise that when I finally found God … He was beside me all along. It was not God who was lost, but me.”*


It is for people like this we pray every day.  Be encouraged and keep praying as the Word of God touches people’s lives all around the world.


**Tomorrow’s prayer journey takes us to one of the last states in India to open to missionaries. See you then.**
