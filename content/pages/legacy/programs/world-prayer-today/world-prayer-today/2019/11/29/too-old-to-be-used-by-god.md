 Too old to be used by God?


November 29, 2019




Too old to be used by God? Not in God’s economy!  


Listen to what Jennifer writes from Cape Coral, Florida:


*“I’m a full-time nurse for a 91-year-old long-time listener of* Thru the Bible*. I’ve been with Esther for 3 1/2 years. I’m happy to report that I am now on the Bible Bus, too. Esther now requires 24-hour care. The four additional caregivers are now learning about* Thru the Bible*, too—and in their original languages! How amazing is that! No one is ever too old or too weak to witness for God! Thank you for spreading God’s Word all around the world and for your many language translations that speak directly to the heart of each listener!”*


Matthew 5:16 says, *“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.”* Today let’s praise God for listeners like Esther and others who are “shining.”


**We’ll celebrate God at work again next week right here on World Prayer Today.**
