 “God is with us.”


November 06, 2019




God’s Word is going out today via *Thru the Bible,* and it is accomplishing the work God has designed it to do. It’s God’s quiet and powerful tool in our lives when we listen and respond in faith. 


Here’s a letter from someone who’s listened for a lifetime in South and Central America: 


*“I give thanks to God for you and your extraordinary work. I listened to this program since 1981, practically from the time I was a little girl, and it represents a blessing for me. I am sure that the same is true for many others. I listened to* A Través de la Biblia *in La Paz, Bolivia, on the station Cruz del Sur, and now am on the Bible Bus in Honduras. You remind me in each study that God is with us and that a life lived for God is not in vain. Thank you and keep going.”*


Thank God today for His work in our lives. Thank you for your faithfulness in prayer … and keep going!   


**Tomorrow our prayer team will meet in** **Haiti****. See you there!**
