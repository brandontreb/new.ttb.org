 An animist finds hope in Jesus


November 22, 2019




*“I worshiped the suns, the moons, the stars, and all kinds of animals.”*


That’s what one *Thru the Bible* listener in India recently wrote to us. He continued:


*“I was born an animist, a religion local to my place. I did not know anything about the church or the God they worshiped. But I hated them. Christians aren’t treated well here, and I thought it was for good reason. But I was in no place to judge. I was an alcoholic, a complete madman walking around the streets without any purpose. I had no concept of joy or peace in my life.* 


*“One day I walked into my friend listening to your radio program. I heard a good message in my own language. It broke me down, in a good way. I met with Jesus and I have never looked back. I am now an active member of my church with a purpose in life. Thank you, Jesus, for taking a sinner like me and giving me hope.”*


Amen! Let’s thank God for giving us His hope for a glorious future. Ask Him to bless the broadcasting of His Word in India and around the world so that more people may experience His saving grace.


**Our journey of praise and celebration continues next week. Join us here.**
