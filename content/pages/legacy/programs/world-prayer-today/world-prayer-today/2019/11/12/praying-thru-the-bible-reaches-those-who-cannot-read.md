 Praying Thru the Bible reaches those who cannot read


November 12, 2019




*“My family has accepted the Lord listening to your program.”*


That’s the good news we heard when a listener of our Hindi language program in Uttar Pradesh, India, called. He continued: 


*“We do not read well and struggled to understand the Word of God. But after listening regularly to your broadcasts our problem is solved. I thank God for these messages that go into my head and travel to my heart and ultimately ignite my soul. I have never experienced such joy before. Your explanations are very clear, and our hearts are refreshed after listening. Please continue to pray for us as we grow in the Lord.”*


Roughly 785 million people worldwide cannot read or write. So today let’s praise God that He is using *Thru the Bible* to reach people in more than 120 languages and dialects. Through these efforts, let’s pray more people will come to know and love our Savior, Jesus Christ.


Want to share the Word of God with your family and friends? Visit us at [TTB.org/listen](http://www.TTB.org/listen) to get our global listening app. 


**Tomorrow we continue to journey through India as we pray our way through Maharashtra. Join us, won’t you?**
