 Praying that righteousness replaces rituals in Denmark


June 24, 2019




Here’s a fun fact: No one in Denmark lives more than 30 miles from the sea.


Thanks for joining us on our World Prayer journey. Today we stop in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, located on one of the largest of its 400 islands.


With one of the highest standards of living in the world and a unique blend of old world charm and forward progressiveness, many think of Denmark as the model of a modern, wealthy country.


But spiritually Denmark is poor. While over 80 percent of the population identifies themselves as Lutheran, church attendance is extremely low (an astonishing two percent) and, even more surprisingly, half of those members report being agnostic or atheist. 


Today, let’s ask God to revive a ritualistic and dying church. And pray for a strong and righteous congregation to grow throughout Denmark.
