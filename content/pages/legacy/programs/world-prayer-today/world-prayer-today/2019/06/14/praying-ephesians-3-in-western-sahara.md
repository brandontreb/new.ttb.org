 Praying Ephesians 3 in Western Sahara


June 14, 2019




With more than 90% of people considered unreached with the gospel, the people of Western Sahara need our prayers.


Welcome to World Prayer Today where we are asking God to intervene in this country that has been subject to dispute and conflict for decades. Pray for open doors for more Christian broadcasters and missionaries to share the name of Jesus with those who have never heard of Him. 


While this may seem like a bold and unrealistic prayer, we trust in God’s Word that tells us in Ephesians 3:20-21, *“**Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,**to Him**be* *glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever.**”*


**Next week the journey continues in South Asia. Hop aboard and join us, won’t you?**
