 “My sight is poor, but my spirit is strong…”


June 25, 2019




*“I need it every day.”* That’s what one German listener tells us about God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible*. 


She continues:


*“My sight is poor, but my spirit is strong! That’s why I’m so excited about your program that is so lively and personal. I’ve learn so much about the interrelations between Old and New Testament as well as the personal challenges of our Lord.* 


*“I have learned to download your programs and I listen to them again later and also use it for discussions with others. I pray the Lord may bless you as you reach others with His good Word.”*


Let’s echo that prayer and ask our mighty God to reach many others in Germany and around the world with the Good News found in His good Word. 


**May the Lord bless and keep you until we meet again tomorrow for more on World Prayer Today.**
