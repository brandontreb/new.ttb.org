 An answer to our prayer for Pakistan


June 20, 2019




Isolated, without a church or a witness or a teacher—that’s how many in Pakistan live. 


Our World Prayer Team has prayed several times for the people who ride the Bible Bus in the Urdu language. Now, here’s some encouragement from the Lord on how He is answering our prayers: 


*“I am a new listener of Christian radio. I was a seeker. I had so many questions in my mind about Jesus and the Bible. But unfortunately I couldn’t get the answers. No Christian preacher lived near my town. Somebody told me about TTB. From the first time I listened, I came to know this is not only a source of information but also it will give the answer of questions. God’s Word brings joy for everyone with a seeker’s heart. It’s a collection of knowledge and blessings. What better than to point us to Jesus?”* 


Yes—what could be better than looking to Jesus? Pray now that the Urdu broadcast of *Thru the Bible* can be effective in bringing truth and life to these isolated places in Pakistan. 


**Tomorrow, we hear from a grateful heart in northern India. Join us there.**
