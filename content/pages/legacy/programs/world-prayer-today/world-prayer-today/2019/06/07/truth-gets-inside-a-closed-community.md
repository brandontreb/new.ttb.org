 Truth gets inside a “closed” community


June 07, 2019




In the early 1900’s, Russian Mennonites left their homeland in search of religious freedom. Some emigrated to the U.S. and Canada. But in 1927, almost two thousand Mennonites left North America to make a home in Paraguay and over the years have turned the arid western region, the Chaco, into fertile farmland.


Today, Mennonite communities span over 19 colonies in Paraguay but they are “closed” communities where it is risky to listen to teaching from outside. This note from a Mennonite sister encourages us to keep praying as change comes to this isolated community: 


*“We like praying for you and your good ministry. I am especially drawn to your teaching program and how much encouragement I get out of it every evening. It is like a voice straight from the Scriptures. What a privilege to listen to God’s Word and to get an explanation in this way. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Recently on my smartphone, I saw the face of the young man who teaches us* [TTB producer of the Low German program]. *I was touched and had to cry a little. Now I can ask the Lord’s blessing for him. Even though he doesn’t know about it, it is a joy to bless him through prayer as I listen to the program.”*


We praise God for His faithful prayer warriors—including you! Join us in asking God to give believers in Paraguay’s Mennonite community the courage and opportunities to listen. 


**Oh, the places our prayers will go next week! Let’s pray as a team through the Middle East!**
