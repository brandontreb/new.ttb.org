 Asking God to intervene for slaves in Mauritania


June 12, 2019




There is no denying it— life in the country of Mauritania is hard.


As one of the least industrialized nations *and* one of the largest recipients of foreign aid in the world, more than one-third of children face chronic malnourishment and many families struggle to afford the basic necessities to survive. 


While the recent discovery of oil holds promise, this country needs our prayers that this natural resource will benefit all people and not increase the divide between rich and poor.


Also in need of prayer are the 10-20% of Mauritanians who live in slavery. As the last nation in the world to abolish slavery in 1981, many still remain in bondage—a fact the government vigorously denies. 


Today, let’s lift up this nation and these people … asking God to intervene with His grace and mercy. As Luke 18:27 tells us, “The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.” 


**Tomorrow we’re off to Israel. We hope you’ll join us and invite a friend for the prayer journey, too.**
