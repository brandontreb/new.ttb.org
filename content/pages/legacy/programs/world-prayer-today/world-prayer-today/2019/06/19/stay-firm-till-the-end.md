 “Stay firm till the end …”


June 19, 2019




*“Continue to pray for us, so that we can be faithful to our Lord and can stay firm till the end.”*


No matter where we live, we face many of the same spiritual temptations—to give up on God and live in our own strength. You might identify with Dora in West Bengal, India: 


*“I am 36 years old, living in a small village. I am really touched by the Word, especially the exposition of the Psalms. God’s Word has inspired me not to take revenge on my enemies, but to forgive them, and leave them in God’s hands. I am convinced that God will deliver me, and nothing can shake me. I used to pray without faith. But I am glad to tell you that after listening to this program, both my husband and I have changed destructive ways. Continue to pray for us, so that we can be faithful to our Lord and can stay firm till the end.”*


If you are struggling to “stay firm till the end,” strengthen your faith in God by praying today for Dora and others like her around the world who want to be faithful to the end. 


**Tomorrow, we travel on our knees across the border from India to Pakistan.**
