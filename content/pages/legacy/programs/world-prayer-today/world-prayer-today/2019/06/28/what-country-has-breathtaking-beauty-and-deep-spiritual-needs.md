 What country has breathtaking beauty and deep spiritual needs?


June 28, 2019




*How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!*  -Romans 10:15


With its magnificent snow-capped peaks and lush green valleys, it’s easy to look at the landscape of Switzerland and be overwhelmed by the creativity and majesty of God’s creation. But within these borders of breathtaking beauty are deep spiritual needs.


Praise God His Word is heard many times throughout the day in Italian and German on *Thru the Bible.* As one woman recently wrote:


*“You are Romans 10:15 to me. You bring Good News and peace. Because I am blind, I rely on your programs to teach me God’s Word. I try and memorize it alongside you. Thank you for the new life you’ve given me as I learn about God’s love.”*


Pray more people in Switzerland will find hope and life in God’s Word. Ask God to replace the spiritual stagnation and apathy of the current generation with a deep yearning for a fresh and vibrant faith in Jesus. 


**Our journey continues next week as we pray our way through the Commonwealth of Independent States and Russia. We hope you’ll hop aboard and join us.**
