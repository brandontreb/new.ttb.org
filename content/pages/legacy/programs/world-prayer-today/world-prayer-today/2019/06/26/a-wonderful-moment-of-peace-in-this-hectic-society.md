 “A wonderful moment of peace … in this hectic society”


June 26, 2019




Welcome, World Prayer Team! We’re glad to have you joining us in the Netherlands where theBible Bus journeys in the Dutch language. 


Let’s praise God that these broadcasts are making a difference in the lives of so many people. As one listener wrote:  


*“It is great that you bring the Good News—the gospel—but also God’s whole Word to people worldwide. I believe that our Lord will bless you, and that He will guide you. I listen to you every morning on my way to work. This is a wonderful moment of peace for me in this hectic society. I have not been a Christian for very long, I was raised in a Christian family and always went to church, but I never really believed. I believe now that the Holy Spirit has spoken to me through your program, and has started to work in me. We have just finished our study of Revelation and I am eager to start over again. To God be all the glory!”*


To Him be all the glory indeed! Please join us in praying more people in the Netherlands will be reached with God’s Word and that *Thru the Bible* resources, like the Dutch language USB stick (also known to us as a flash drive), will continue to encourage and teach the many Bible study groups that meet in listeners’ homes.


**Join us tomorrow as we find undiscovered treasure in Spain!**
