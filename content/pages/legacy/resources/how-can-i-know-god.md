description: "Thru the Bible with Dr. J. Vernon McGee - Taking the whole Word to the whole world"
---




**The most important question in life is "How can I know God?" If you’re wondering that today, then we are so glad to share with you the only answer that will ever satisfy your heart. It’s a wonderful, true answer found in the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Himself was asked in John 14 how we can be with the Father. He said, *“I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”***


Our prayer is that you would indeed come to know God the Father, through His Son Jesus Christ. Your joy or your sorrow for this life and all eternity depends on your response to Jesus’ invitation. Your destination one moment after you die also depends on your willingness to see your need for a Savior and to believe that need is answered in Jesus’ promise of eternal life.


This is the most important decision of your life. Find out more about God’s wonderful offer of salvation from our Bible teacher, Dr. J. Vernon McGee, in the following resources. Take your time--read and listen to Dr. McGee’s message with a willingness for God to show you the truth and then to follow Him by faith.
