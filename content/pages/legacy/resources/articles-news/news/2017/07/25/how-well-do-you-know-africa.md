## Think back to geography class and quiz yourself on the following questions:


1.    How many people live in Africa?   

       a.    One billion  

       b.    500 million  

       c.    50 million






### **Answer:** A—one billion. According to World Census Bureau, the world’s population is now approximately 7.5 billion. (U.S. population is approximately 350 million.)


2.    How many languages and dialects are spoken in Africa?   

       a.    Between 50-75   

       b.    Between 500-750  

       c.    Between 1500-2000






### **Answer:**  C—1500-2000. *Thru the Bible* airs in 25 of the major languages, including the most common—Arabic, Somali, Hausa, Yoruba, Amharic, Oromo, and Swahili—which are spoken by tens of millions of people. 

In 2016, *Thru the Bible* began broadcasting in Kinyarwanda, a language spoken by more than 10 million people in Rwanda, Tanzania, Congo, Burundi, and Uganda. While it is still early, response has been very positive. Pray for impact!


3.    Which of the following is true about Africa?   

       a.    Malaria kills about twice as many people as AIDS and tuberculosis combined.  

       b.    In the last 20 years, the most wars on the planet have been fought in Africa.   

       c.    Half of Africa’s population is under the age of 25.   

       d.    All of the above.






### **Answer:** D—All of the above. Pray for those scarred by disease, violence, and war to find their healing in Jesus Christ. Intercede especially for this young generation of Africans to hear the gospel and turn to God for salvation.


4.    Between 1900 and 2010, evangelicals grew from 1.6 million to 182 million—the largest evangelical population of any continent. True or false?






### **Answer:** True. The heavy influence of Islam and the Muslim way of life is coloring the map of Africa, moving south from North African nations, especially Algeria and Egypt.  Yet in spite of the opposition, Christianity is also expanding through the witness of bold believers and outreach to Muslim neighbors.


**Text from a listener of the Kinyarwanda broadcast in Rwanda:** *“I felt God would never accept me. I am 21 years old and was born in a family that practices witchcraft. My father is a great sorcerer and my relatives believe in evil powers. In my teenage years, I did many immoral things. But then I heard your programs on Romans 3:23-24. I was very happy to know that Jesus died for my sins and He can forgive me. I thank God as I am now redeemed by the grace of Jesus. I want to live my life differently; I pray He will help me because I am often weak. Please keep broadcasting. God’s Word gives me strength.”*
