 Reaching into One of the Last Communist Strongholds—Vietnam

In 1967, the year of the first *Thru
the* *Bible* broadcast
aired as we know it today, the country of Vietnam was in turmoil. The fight
against Communism raged. The people and the nation were in crisis. In many
ways, it’s taken these five decades of difficult, faithful outreach in Vietnam
to establish trusted relationships with national church leaders and to
consistently reach out with the quiet, personal instruction of God’s Word.   

  

Even today, Vietnam—one of the world’s
five Communist countries—survives under the stronghold of a harsh government.
Believers in the Lord Jesus Christ suffer harassment, discrimination, and
persecution. This is where the World Prayer Team travels this month.   

  

This precious nation of 90 million souls
remains at an ever-expanding crossroads. We see God’s favor in strategically allowing
growing technology, carried by the hands of faithful servants working in their networks of
influence to reach Vietnamese people with the gospel.   

  

Here’s a fun fact: More than 150 million cell phones
are in use in Vietnam—and 30% of those are smart phones. A large population
listens to *Thru the Bible* in Vietnamese, Hmong, and six other dialects
through FEBC’s “audio hub” system. Thousands of listeners, especially in the
rural countryside, also listen to God’s Word delivered on memory cards and
speaker boxes, often gathering in groups or as villages.   

  

Thanks to those who
financially and prayerfully stand with *Thru the Bible*, the gospel is
proclaimed in word and deed at every God-given opportunity in Vietnam,
equipping followers of Jesus Christ to make disciples in their own culture and
across cultural boundaries. Through the faithfulness of our listeners and
workers in Vietnam, we are witnessing spiritual impact that this world has
never seen before and for which eternity will boast.
### Pray for the people of Vietnam



* Pray this month that every Vietnamese would have
 opportunity to hear the gospel and for their willingness to believe God’s Word.
* Pray for God’s blessing and favor on TTB’s ministry
 in Vietnam—especially through the speaker box project and the “audio hub”
 system.
* Pray for our Vietnamese brothers and sisters in
 Christ who face persecution when they share the gospel. Pray for their
 strength, courage, and protection.
