## Every week on the World Prayer Team, we intercede for those far from God in every country of the world. But, surprisingly, what happens when they hear the Bible taught is many respond in faith.

***… Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.*** -Romans 10:17

### We pray for the spiritually persecuted.

A respected businessman in Iraq discovers new life in Christ, but his family despises his choice to follow Jesus. They not only refuse to say his name again, but they seek his life. “*But please don’t worry*,” he whispers to us. “*Now that I know Jesus is the only Savior, my life is safe in His. I will not stray. Please pray for my family*.”

### We pray for the culturally removed.

It was the first time the young man in North Korea heard the gospel, explained to him by his neighbor who secretly listens to Christian radio. “*If what you say is true*,” he contests, “*then everything we’ve been taught is a lie. What do we do with that?”* 

### We pray for those who walk in darkness.

The young rickshaw driver in Hong Kong heard the Bible teach “God already is wherever you go,” and so he asked God to walk with him into frightening places. “*If* *He is the light of the world*,” he said, “*I will stand in His shadow.”*

### No matter where we live, God sees us all—individually. He hears our cry for Him.

## *Join us in crying out for them!* Sign up for the World Prayer Team at [TTB.org/pray](https://www.TTB.org/pray) and travel the world on your knees.
