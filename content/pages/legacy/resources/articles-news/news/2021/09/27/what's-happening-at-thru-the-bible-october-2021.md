[BlueLetterBible.org](https://www.blueletterbible.org/) is one of our great digital partners, and it’s extraordinary they’ve been doing online ministry since 1996! **They were a pioneer in what, in those days, was an untested ministry platform. We’re so grateful that, through our partnership with them, in a typical year 2-3 million downloads and streams of Dr. McGee’s teaching are heard.”**  -Gregg Harris
