## THRU the BIBLE’s Social Media Refreshed

In an increasingly digital world, it’s important to reach people with God’s Word wherever they spend their time. As a tool to shine God’s light into darkness, THRU the BIBLE’s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages share daily encouragement and the good news of the gospel with anyone who wants to receive it.  

### Have you visited THRU the BIBLE on social media in the last year? It’s a great place to get spiritual encouragement.

We may never fully know or see the eternal impact of God at work through our social media pages. It’s just one small rung on the trellis in THRU the BIBLE’s goal to get the whole Word to the whole world.  

*For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal*. -2 Corinthians 4:18
