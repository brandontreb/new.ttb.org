 The Heart of Advent


November 29, 2021

One of Dr. McGee’s favorite things was to point out Jesus on every page of the Bible. Well, this month, we’re doing something similar on our social media platforms and pointing out Jesus in all four themes of advent: Hope, peace, love, and joy. 

## Find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/THRUtheBIBLEnet/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/THRUtheBIBLEnet/), or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/THRUtheBIBLEnet/) (/ThruTheBibleNet), and each day from November 28 through December 31 be reminded of the true “Heart of Advent”—the *real* reason we celebrate.

Friends, Jesus is the reason we have hope, peace, love, and joy this Christmas. Let's celebrate Him in all His glory and wonder and give thanks for the eternal gifts He has given us.

### We pray these social media posts will be a gift of encouragement to you and your loved ones this Christmas season.
