## A Man on a Mission

Ever since I met Christ, I have been passionate about creating and delving into new ways to connect every person, in every language, to the Bible so they can come to know why Christ is so wonderful. 

To that end, I’ve had the privilege of helping to build the world’s largest digital Bible platform in over 1800 languages that touches over 600 million users in 240 countries. 

Today we’re asking the question: How can we help people better engage with the Bible? How do we harness technology, leverage platforms, and provide resources for ministries like THRU the BIBLE to take the whole Word to the whole world?

Today, 97% of the world’s population have access to a mobile device, and over 5 billion people have a smartphone. In remote areas of the world where people may not have shoes or plumbing, many have a smartphone in their back pocket and can listen to THRU the BIBLE! Our ability to take God’s Word to every person is truly viable if we build the systems to deliver it to them directly. 

This is essentially Jesus’ Great Commission in Matthew 28: Go into all the world and into every *system*. Go and fish for every man and woman because every soul is so precious to Him. This is what God is doing today at THRU the BIBLE.
