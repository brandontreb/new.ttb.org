 One Region—One Request: Southeast Asia


January 29, 2019
![Pray for Southeast Asia](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Features-and-News/feb-2019-southeast-asia.jpg?sfvrsn=82261e16_0 "Feb 2019 Southeast Asia")




## Pray for our unique opportunity in Southeast Asia:


*The church in Southeast Asia is growing, despite its two Communist governments in Laos and Vietnam. Pray for the availability of alternative delivery systems to reach millions in unreached groups outside of urban areas.*


This month, let’s pray together, specifically for the very effective delivery of God’s Word in Vietnam through “hubs” where *Thru the Bible* is distributed on chips that work in cell phones and speaker boxers. 


Here’s what one listener tells us about this technology. 


“I sell eggs in the market to take care of my 10-year-old granddaughter. We live in a shack on muddy ground in the middle of nowhere.  We have no running water and no electricity, but my friend at the market introduced me to Jesus and gave me a speaker box. I charge the box when I visit the market and we walk about three hours to return and replace the lessons on the chips.  The speaker box is our only link to God’s Word. It gives me great peace to cuddle up with my granddaughter and listen to your messages every evening. We have many favorites, but the series on Philippians is our very favorite. We love to hear about the joy we can find in this life through Jesus.”
