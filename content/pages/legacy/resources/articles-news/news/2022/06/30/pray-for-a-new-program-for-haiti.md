 Pray for a New Program for Haiti

It's hard to believe it’s been 12 years since the world’s attention turned to the island nation of Haiti following the devastating 7.0 magnitude temblor that struck on the afternoon of January 12, 2010 and killed over 200,000 people. It was just one more disaster in a country that has suffered from decades of political, economic, and social setbacks and inequalities. Insecurity due to gang fights makes life here impossible.

## Haiti needs Jesus.

“The most important objective in bringing *Thru the Bible* to Haiti is to hold out hope in the midst of despair and abandonment,” says Annabel Torrealba, our TWR regional partner. “*Thru the Bible’s* broadcasts on 4VEH are bringing life to the lost and spiritual strength to the believers. Certainly, in the country 40% of the population speaks French, but the heart language of the people is Creole. 99.9% of the inhabitants speak Creole. During difficult times, hearing hope in the language of your heart is key, it brings comfort and peace.”

Please pray for the completion of THRU the BIBLE in Creole. It’s been a long and difficult process impacted by setbacks and hurdles. Currently only one translator, Samuel, has been working on the project—translating, recording, and editing new programs while we continue to air those already completed by the longtime “voice of McGee” in Creole, Storly Michel. Pray for Samuel to have the strength, wisdom, and grace to complete his important work. 

## Haiti needs THRU the BIBLE.

Even though Haiti enjoys the freedom of religion, many still incorporate practices of voodoo and a form of West African witchcraft into their faith practices. Haitians need to be taught the Bible. Since over half the population cannot read, the radio is a primary source of communication across the island nation. Local believers are thrilled by what they currently are studying with THRU the BIBLE and beg for more. Pray with them that God’s will be done in the timing and release of the TTB-Creole program.

## In spite of many harsh realities, God is at work across Haiti. Pray as we play a part in bringing them THRU the BIBLE.

### *I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,* *always in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy, for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.* -Philippians 1:3-6
