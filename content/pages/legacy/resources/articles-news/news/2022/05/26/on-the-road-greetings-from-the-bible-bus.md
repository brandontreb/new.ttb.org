 On the Road—Greetings from the Bible Bus

## “A Bible was left behind at the apartment I moved into . . .”

Here’s how one woman from Kosovo describes the beginning of her faith journey.  

“About the time I turned 30, my fear of death intensified. My Muslim faith was of no help. I was overcome with morbid thoughts and began to develop agoraphobia. I was desperate to find peace. Even when I was young, I always wondered what the reason of this life was. It seemed we are young, we grow older, get a job, have a family, then there is retirement, and no matter how many days we have left, in the end we all die and become dust. It seemed pointless. But when my fears overcame me, I started to search outside of Islam. Although it’s hard to find Christian materials here, a Bible was left behind at the apartment I moved into. I began to read, and although I understood almost nothing, somehow I knew that I should continue. Then I found your program. 

“My perspective and outlook on life have changed completely since then. I discovered that life is full of meaning and that we are all here for a purpose. It was as if I was falling more and more in love with God's Word as I listened to Dr. McGee every night. God changed me and called me to surrender completely to Him, which I eventually did. Indescribable joy came to my heart, and everyone saw that something had happened to me. 

“A lot has changed in my life since then. I started a wonderful walk with God. His Word shows us and illuminates the path we should take. God has given me peace and purpose. I keep listening because I always come across a new revelation that helps me face the daily challenges that life imposes on us.” 

**Did you know?**  Beginning last year on the Sunday Sermon, you’re able to listen to various sermons from Dr. McGee which have never before been on the air. If you relate to this sister’s story from Kosovo, [listen to Dr. McGee’s Sunday Sermon, “What Do You Do with Your Fears?” which airs on stations May 28, 2022.](https://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-sunday-sermon/listen/)
