## Celebrate the best day of the year!

As we study the whole Word of God, we see that everything hinges on this—Jesus’ death and resurrection. It’s the most important event in the history of the world and the truth that makes your life in Christ possible today. Spend a quiet moment thanking the Lord Jesus for His sacrifice and for the gift of your salvation. Make this your most important hour of the year, too. 

### *That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death. -*Philippians 3:10

## An Easter gift for you ...

As we approach Easter, take some time to thank God for His gift of salvation and His promise to come again.
