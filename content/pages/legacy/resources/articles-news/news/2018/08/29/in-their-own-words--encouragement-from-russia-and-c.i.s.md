 In Their Own Words--Encouragement from Russia and C.I.S.

**The TWR director ofministry in charge of getting *Thru the Bible* programming to Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (formed when the former Soviet Union, now called Russia, dissolved in 1991) is thrilled to share with you what it’s like to share God’s Word with the people of Russia and the C.I.S.** 


The joy of being involved in making the Good News available to the people is immense. Just imagine: You are the guest of honor at a celebration! The anticipation is almost unbearable. And then, at the right time, you are having fellowship with the ones who invited you and everyone is eager to hear what you have to say. You do not waste time, but get right to business ….


“Dear friends, today we will continue our study in the book of–let’s say Psalms.” Even from their homes, most people have hurried to finish their chores, are washed up, and many even dressed up. This radio program is their church, and they have come to worship and learn about their God and Savior. 


Another group of listeners are pastors of small congregations. No, they didn’t and don’t have the time or the means to get a theological education. You are providing that for them! Monday through Friday, same time, same frequency, they come to learn. They open their Bibles and get ready to take notes. Often they memorize what they hear. After the 5-year cycle, the pastors have a basic theological education. 


The guest of honor at our celebrations is the beloved 30-minute program, *Thru the Bible*. It is education for future pastors in Russia, Ukraine, and also in Belarus. And you make it happen for us. Our hearts flood with gratitude. Do you know what joy you bring?


### Intercede for ministry in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus:


* Pray for better broadcast reception during the late summer and early fall. Near winter, it gets better again.
* Praise God for the Word of God delivered to thousands of homes and villages throughout the C.I.S.
* Pray for future pastors and for those who conduct 3-5 visits of small groups each week besides being the pastor-shepherd of a country or city church.
