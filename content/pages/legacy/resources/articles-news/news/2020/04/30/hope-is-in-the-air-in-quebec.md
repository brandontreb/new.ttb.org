### A report from Eric Perron, *Aujourd’hui l’Espoir*

For 15 years, TWR-Canada has been working with *Aujourd’hui l’Espoir* (“Today’s Hope,” a French radio and television station), reaching out to the people of Quebec with a message of hope in Jesus Christ. 


The ministry in Quebec is not easy, but we have seen how media can play a role in sharing the gospel in a non-confrontational way. Many people will not walk through the door of a church, but they will listen to a radio program or download a Christian program off the internet because it can all be done in privacy. This has opened a door, making media a very effective tool for communicating to people who have a spiritual void in their lives, but don’t know how to fill that void.


The media approach has proven to be effective in multiple formats. The number of programs downloaded from *Aujourd’hui l’Espoir's* websites increases every year. *Thru the Bible* has been downloaded 118,000 times. We continue to broadcast to southern Quebec through radio, and through pastors in our local church networks across the province, we have the privilege of doing many personal visits which are resulting in people committing their lives to Christ.

The motion was denied due to technicalities and has been resubmitted. Fourteen churches in Quebec have agreed to host repeater stations for their communities. Join us in praying for favor from the CRTC and the local community so that the truth of God and His Word would be proclaimed through the radio in Quebec. 


### *“I was curious about the Bible but couldn’t understand it. I was becoming a bit frustrated until I found your programs in French. Your teachings are a rich feast for a hungry soul. I learned about what Jesus has offered me through His death on the cross. I called your office for more explanation. I was surprised to talk with someone who prayed with me on the phone. Now I am completely satisfied. Wherever I find myself, I am content and at peace. Knowing God and understanding His Word has made all the difference. Those closest to me have recognized this change. It is my pleasure to tell them about Jesus and direct them to* Thru the Bible.*”*



## Please pray:


* Pray for the people of Quebec, that they would accept the truth of God.
* Pray for the resubmission to the CRTC of the FM transmitter license to be accepted.
* Pray for the pastors and church workers across Quebec who are connecting with and visiting listeners in their homes.
* Pray as the Holy Spirit moves that more French Canadians recognize their spiritual hunger and ultimately come by faith to belief in Jesus Christ.
