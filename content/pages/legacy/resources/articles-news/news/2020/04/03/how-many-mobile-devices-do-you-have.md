By Gregg Harris, *Thru the Bible*, President


**Let’s run the numbers . . .** 


Right now, seven out of ten people on earth have a mobile device. Many have more than one. Over 7.5 billion people live on earth using more than 9.5 billion mobile connections (approximately 5.2 billion unique mobile subscribers). 


 . . . And digital technology has only just begun in reaching the world. 


*Thru the Bible* is taking seriously the challenge to reach people through mobile devices, the central communication and information tool used by people around the globe. This is vitally important to fulfilling our mission to take the whole Word to the whole world.


In order to accomplish this, we are developing new ministry partnerships with organizations that have unique expertise in reaching people via digital platforms. Recently, we placed Dr. McGee’s teaching from the Gospel of John on Jesus.net, an internet ministry with multiple digital distribution channels. Based on their experience, the team at Jesus.net anticipated we would receive several hundred responses to this ministry initiative. We received over 3,000 responses and many indicated significant commitment to our Lord Jesus Christ. God is gracious to open new ways for us to tell the old story of Jesus and His love.

## Responses to our 21-day Gospel of John study on JESUS.NET
