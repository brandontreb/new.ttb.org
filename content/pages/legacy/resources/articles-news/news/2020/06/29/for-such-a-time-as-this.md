## The Impact of *Thru the Bible* Home Groups in India during COVID-19

### by George Philip, TWR Director of TTB-India

The COVID-19 pandemic affects our every thought, every decision, and every action every moment of the day. We have no idea what tomorrow may bring. We may wonder if the stories we see on television today will become our story tomorrow. Amid such turmoil, we long for comfort, stability, and hope. The Radio Home has become the source of comfort and hope for many. Radio Home enables every member to grow in His Word by discovering, discussing, and exploring truths, while making every effort to obey Him and the Holy Spirit even behind closed doors.

The lockdown that began on March 22 caught everyone by surprise, especially the church as it was not prepared for it. Very few churches that are tech savvy began to have online services, prayer meetings, and Bible study, but only a limited number of people can access it. The majority are left with no one to take care of them. Of course, social media is flooded with Christian content now for those who can access it. But people are doubtful whom to believe, as there is more false information than true. When TWR-India started the *Thru the Bible* Home Groups, many churches were skeptical and suspicious. But today they are all convinced that in the present times and in the days ahead, small groups would be ideal for a country like India. We truly believe the concept of *Thru the Bible* is a God-given gift to this nation for a time such as this. 

Little did we know we would be in a lockout situation where even for the *Thru the Bible* Home Groups to meet is a challenge. The families that received a player and the Bible study in their heart language are thriving even in the midst of this crisis. 

Recently a local pastor, Pastor Sunil, connected with our staff to share about the impact of the audio players we distributed to groups listening to the *Thru the Bible* study in the Malto language. They are so grateful for this resource, and they listen to it every day from 10pm to 2am in the quietness of the night. 

Our teams are in constant touch with the groups and the testimonies we are getting are heartening. We are so thankful to God. 

We want you to know that your prayer investment is timely and the seed that is being sown will yield a huge harvest. 

## India’s Home Groups Thrive in the Covid-19 Crisis

### “Blessed family time”

**A Radio Home leader from Kanpur says,** “Every evening we sit and listen to the Word of God as a family. We also make the study available to our church members and friends to encourage them. I am happy that I have Radio Home at my place and my church members also appreciate this study. This time of quarantine is a blessing in disguise to my family as we are able to spend quality time studying the Word of God together, which we were missing earlier. I praise God for His great plan for our family.”  

### “This is our Church now”

**A Rathwi language producer said,** “We are a poor and underprivileged community.  But through this we are able to provide a wonderful Bible study to my people. The groups listen regularly and now during the situation with Covid-19, I can see that it is a great help to our believers. Many testify, ‘Now, this is our church.’”  

### “Radio Home stands in the gap”

**A TTB Home Group leader from the Malvi language, Pastor Arjunsingh Osari, says,** “I have a church at Manpur, but due to the lockdown we cannot meet. Nevertheless, the families in our congregation meet every night and study the Word of God using the audio player. It is amazing to listen to the Word in our mother tongue. We are assured that we can still worship God and be nurtured in the Word even if the church building is shut down. This could not have been possible without your help.”  


### “The only source for our family’s spiritual growth”

**A Home Group member from the Mewadi language group says,** “I am a housewife and run a Radio Home Group regularly. Due to Covid-19 crisis, we are locked at home and it has become a blessing to our family as we are able to sit every day and study the Word of God as a family. This is the only source of our spiritual growth. We praise God for this wonderful study.”
