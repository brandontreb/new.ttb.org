 Praying our way through the Holy Land

### As we travel together on our knees, God is answering our prayers! That’s the good news we’re sharing on World Prayer Today.


Consider this letter we received from Modar, a listener of our Arabic broadcasts in Israel:


*“I have come to know Jesus. I’m learning a lot from you and am understanding more my new Christian life. It is so different from how I have been raised and taught, but I believe that Jesus is Lord! Thank you for helping me realize this and to begin my new life in Him.”*


Isn’t that great? As you may know, only 2% of Israelis know Jesus. So, as we pray, let’s ask the Lord to increase *Thru the Bible’s* opportunity to reach more people with His Word in the languages of Hebrew and Arabic. .


**Our worldwide prayer trek brings us to the Western Sahara tomorrow. Join us on your knees.**
