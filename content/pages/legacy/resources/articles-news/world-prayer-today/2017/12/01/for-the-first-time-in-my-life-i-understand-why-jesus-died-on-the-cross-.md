 “For the first time in my life, I understand why Jesus died on the cross.”

*“For the first time in my life, I understand why Jesus died on the cross.”*


That’s the good news we recently received from a listener of our Afrikaans broadcasts in South Africa. Celebrate with us as we share the rest of her story:


“I listen to your program during my lunch hour in the car. When I can’t do that, I get up at 4:00 in the morning to listen. This is my daily Bible study time and I don’t miss a single message. Thank you for introducing me to my Savior and for helping me fall in love with His Word.”


What an encouraging report! As we continue our worldwide journey of praise, let’s thank God for the work He is doing in South Africa. Let’s also keep praying that more listeners of our Afrikaans broadcast will hear God’s Word and respond in faith. 


**We’re praying and praising our way through Albania on Monday. Join us on World Prayer Today.**
