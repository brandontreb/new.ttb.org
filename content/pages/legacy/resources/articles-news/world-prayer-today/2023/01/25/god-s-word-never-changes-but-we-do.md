 God’s Word never changes, but we do

***“I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.”*** -Ezekiel 36:26

If you’ve hopped aboard the Bible Bus with us for more than one five-year journey, you know that God’s Word never changes—but we do. We’re not the same people we were the last time we studied a certain passage. Our circumstances, our joys, our sorrows, our perspectives shift over time. Things we weren’t prepared to catch or know at an earlier point in life may now stand out. That’s what Klaus recently discovered as he traveled again through Dr. McGee’s studies of Ezekiel. He shares:

*“**I have been a loyal listener to your program for a very long time. Although I have heard the messages before, they are always very insightful. This time the teaching from Ezekiel touched me strongly and made me awake. I am not sure why among all the others we are studying this one continues to stand out, but I am praying God makes me aware of the purpose. Thank you for your continued work in making THRU the BIBLE available. I will continue to listen and learn.”*

Today thank God for His Word that is an unending source of wisdom and encouragement for our lives. As we study the pages of Scripture together, pray His Spirit shapes us, molds us, uses us, and fills our hearts of flesh each and every day so we become more like Jesus.

***“God sees, God cares, and God speaks*****.****” That’s what we hear from a listener in Zimbabwe. Travel with us tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
