 Pray for the young ones

***“Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.******”***-*Deuteronomy 11:18-19* 

Welcome to Guatemala. As our World Prayer Team prays our way through Central America and the Caribbean today, we stop and meet with Amanda who joins us on the Bible Bus in Spanish. She shares:

*“I live in Guatemala City and am 22 years old. I started listening to you about three years ago with my mom and my little sister. Actually, my whole family listens.* 

*“I gave my heart to Jesus when I was seven years old. I want you know that this Bible study has strengthened my relationship with Jesus. I feel that every day I love Him more. You are a blessing for my family and life. We pray for you constantly and pray other families will have the benefit of learning God’s Word together.”*

As we thank God for Amanda and pray more families will join us on the Bible Bus in 2023, let’s ask God to use us in mighty ways to share His Word with the children in our lives as well. *Deuteronomy 11:18-19 is the perfect place to start.*

*Father, thank You for the gift of Your Word in our lives. We pray entire families in Guatemala and around the world will receive the blessings of studying Your Word together this year. For the children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, neighbors, and all the children in our lives, may we speak of Your greatness constantly … in the morning, in the evening, in our weakness and our strength, in the good times and in the bad. Give us Your words to say when the time is right. Give us the strength and sensitivity to speak with love, and the courage to live as examples of Your grace. May those we influence see our joy in living for You. In Jesus’ name we pray, amen.*

**There are many barriers to the gospel in Central Asia, but God’s Word is getting through. Pray with us tomorrow in Tajikistan.**
