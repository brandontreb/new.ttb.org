 Singing God’s praises in Rwanda


January 10, 2023

***My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing to You,******and my soul, which You have redeemed.*** -Psalm 71:23

In 1994, the world was horrified as 800,000 Rwandans lost their lives in 100 days, and more than one million more fled as the violence raged on. Today Rwanda is rebuilding. Government ethnic identification is banned, and the economy is one of the fastest growing throughout Africa.

As we praise God for His people who have helped lead the movement of healing and reconciliation, we also thank Him for His Word that continues change the lives of listeners like this one:

*“Your teachings are a great surprise. I have begun to follow every day because it is very good. The program brings me deeper in the Holy Scriptures, and most assuredly you are a blessing to me. I am not Christian, but I would like to become one. So, please pray for me.”*

**The adventure in prayer continues tomorrow. Join us as we pray for listeners who are sharing God’s Word in Australia.**
