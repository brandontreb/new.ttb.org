 Giving up the grime to become godly

***Restore to me the joy of Your salvation,******and uphold me by Your generous Spirit.*** -Psalm 51:12

Welcome, World Prayer Team. Our journey through southern Europe today begins as we visit with a truck driver in Greece. He shares:

*“I’ve been a believer for the past 12 years. Over the last few, I’ve left the way of the Lord to go back to the things of the world. My life was dirty, filled with bad decisions. I knew God did not approve of my behavior. I wanted to start improving my life, to give up the grime and become more godly, but I didn’t know how. Thank you for your teaching that has helped start the process. My wife and children never came to church, but never hindered me. Pray for me, so that I can make the right decisions and find the strength to continue living for Him, and please pray for them that we might someday worship as a family.”*

Today, thank God that even when we’ve sinned, He offers us a way back. Together let’s pray more people in southern Europe hear His Word and realize He is faithful to redeem and uphold us. As we study His Word together, may we find strength we need to live a life that pleases Him.

**Burundi is a tough place to live, but God is raising up joyful believers to share His Word. Join us as we pray for them tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
