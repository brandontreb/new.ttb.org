 A wise investment

***“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”*** -Matthew 6:21

In our fast-paced world, time is the ultimate treasure. That’s what we hear from a listener named Peaches in Manila. She shares:

*“Thank you for the message. What a wonderful thing to start the day. Pastor, you are such a blessing to me and my family. Even my kids are enjoying listening to your sermons. With our busy lives, it has been hard for us to commit to such a study. But after doing so, the benefits have been evident. Our hearts are now closer aligned with God’s; thank you for this gift to us.”*

It’s true, God’s Word *is* a gift! Today thank Him for the many throughout the Philippines who invest their time on the Bible Bus with us and ask Him to draw more aboard. Together, let’s also thank Him for this reminder that as we study together, He will reveal Himself to us and align our hearts with His.

**“I want more of God every day.” That’s what we hear from a listener in Vietnam tomorrow. See you there.**
