 Pray for healing and reconciliation in Fiji

***There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.*** -Galatians 3:28

On a previous prayer journey to the gorgeous island of Fiji we learned that throughout history, Indo-Fijians have lived difficult lives. 

Before gaining independence, indentured servants from India were brought to work in the sugarcane fields, leading to a history of racism and segregation between natives and Indian Fijians that continues today. 

Making up more than 35% of the population (with the majority of them practicing Hinduism), they are denied land rights although they are leaders in commercial activity. 

So as we enjoy taking in the views of white sandy beaches and stunning blue seas, pray that THRU the BIBLE is heard in Hindi and offers hope and healing to discouraged and distraught hearts. As people’s lives are transformed as they come to God in faith, may the spirit of division be replaced with God’s love, unity, and peace.

**We’re one step closer to our goal of reaching the whole world with the whole Word. Get the inside scoop tomorrow in Papua New Guinea.**
