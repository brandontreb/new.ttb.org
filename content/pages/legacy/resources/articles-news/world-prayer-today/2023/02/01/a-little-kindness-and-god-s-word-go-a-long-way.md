 A little kindness and God’s Word go a long way

***And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.*** -Ephesians 4:32

*“Why are you so kind, when I am critical of you?”*

That’s the question Isaias in Eritrea asked his manager at work. The answer changed his life. Here’s his story:

*“Influenced by the attitude of my family, I had no use of Christians. I was raised thinking they are self-righteous snobs who think they have all the answers and look down on anyone who's different from them. When I got a job at a restaurant, the manager was a vibrant Christian. He annoyed me and I harassed him. But he looked past my weary exterior and saw a hurting heart that needed love and acceptance, not criticism.* 

*“I was drawn into his patience and kindness. One day I dared to ask him about his different character from all the bosses I met before. He smiled and told me he was what he was because of Jesus Christ. Suddenly I felt the need for the same Jesus. He is also the one who told me about your ministry. Months have passed, and I am following your program. This has enabled me to follow through on my determination to follow Christ and grow spiritually. Thank you for your investment in my life. The kindnesses shown to me by my manager and God have saved my life. I pray I may be an instrument in sharing this type of kindness to others.”*

Thank God for his lovingkindness and the people He chooses to express it. Ask Him to whom you might show kindness today. A neighbor? A friend? Someone who uses harsh words against you or appears aggressive? Ask God to give us His heart as we interact with others, so like Isaias they too will notice the difference and be drawn to Him.

**We’re praying our way through Uganda tomorrow. Join us as our journey through eastern Africa continues.**
