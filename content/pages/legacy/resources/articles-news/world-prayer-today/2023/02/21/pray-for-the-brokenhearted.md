 Pray for the brokenhearted

***But those who wait on the******Lord******shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.*** -Isaiah 40:31

As we travel through the Word of God together, Steve often reminds us to stop, reflect and share what God is teaching us. That’s also true of our producers around the world. Here’s how Barbara in Bosnia and Herzegovina responded to that prompt.

*“Thank you for your programs that guide me. I especially remember one period of my life when I was completely broken, burdened by a problem for which I did not see a solution. Everything in my life was at a halt because of this issue. I was doing a job where I needed to serve others and I didn’t even have enough strength to get out of bed the next day. However, it was the TTB program I was listening to on the radio that night that was a real boost for me. Then, for the first time in my life, I fully experienced the truth of Isaiah 40:31. I realized that while serving others, I give a small part of myself, but I receive much more. During those days, I was encouraged in incredible ways through this teaching. Although I did not know how the problem would be solved, I was sure that God would help me resolve it. And, so it was. God found a solution that was better than any solution I could have imagined. Out of all this I became spiritually stronger and more mature, empowered by God's Word to face life's challenges, sure that in other life struggles that follow I do not stand alone, but have someone who is there to carry me through every situation.”*

Wow, what a message for us today. As we pray, let’s thank God for this reminder that He is with us:

*Thank You Lord for this letter of hope. We pray for all our brother and sisters in* *Bosnia and Herzegovina, and around the world,* *who are grieving. As we hop aboard the Bible Bus, renew our hearts, souls, and minds through Your Word. Grant each of us the strength to walk the hard, narrow road. Give us the focus to conquer obstacles in our way. We are grateful to know we aren’t alone and thank You that You will carry us through our heartbreak if we only trust in You. In the precious name of Jesus we pray, amen.*

**A listener in Greece is “bubbling over” with excitement about God’s Word. Hear his encouraging story tomorrow.**
