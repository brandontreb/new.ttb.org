 God see us when others don’t

***“I will never leave you nor forsake you.”*** -Hebrews 13:5

God sees us even when others don’t. That’s what Gil in Spain is finding out as we travel together on the Bible Bus. Here’s his story:

*“I am a security guard in permanent night shift. I read and listen to the radio programs you make. I am recently divorced and because of my schedule, I do not see people very much. You help me not only to understand the Word of God better, but to fight this loneliness that makes the soul sick. I am beginning to understand that God is the only one I can trust. He always has His eyes on me and will never let me go.”*

What an important lesson. Even when we feel all alone, God is with us. Today lift up all those who feel invisible, unseen, or unloved by those around them. As they study His Word, may they feel valued, and loved as His precious children.

**We’re praying for the brokenhearted tomorrow. Join us in Bosnia and Herzegovina.**
