 Overcoming obstacles to the gospel in Cuba


February 10, 2023

***“They will fight against you,******but they shall not prevail against you. For I am with you,” says the Lord, “to deliver you.”*** -Jeremiah 1:19

In 2010 Cuba officially shifted from an atheist nation to a secular one. While overt religious persecution diminished, God’s church is still under surveillance and His people still face loss of work, inability to apply for top jobs, denied access to universities, unreliable utilities, and even imprisonment. 

Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we travel through this totalitarian state, we praise God His Word has been heard through the years by listeners like this one:

*“Greetings from Cuba. I thank God for this blessed ministry. I received Christ as my Savior at 17 years old (I am now 50). All these years I have listened to THRU the BIBLE. It is a great spiritual feast in this land of starvation! At this moment I am a pastor of a small gathering of believers, and we feel God’s presence and protection. Please keep teaching, knowing we are listening and grateful to continue to receive the Good News you so generously share.”*

It's an age-old story. Man tries to suppress Him, but God prevails. Thank Him for His promise in Jeremiah 1:19 and His Word that has been heard throughout generations in Cuba. As THRU the BIBLE is heard today, ask His Spirit to stir in the hearts of many and bring them into a relationship with Jesus.

**We’ve got a lot to pray about next week in Central Asia. Join us here on World Prayer Today.**
