 Pray Philippians 2:10-11 in Kyrgyzstan

***That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.*** -Philippians 2:10-11

Welcome, World Prayer Team. Our journey brings us to Kyrgyzstan where 89% of people are Muslim (with many also participating in ancestor worship and the occult), and Christians are often intimidated through property destruction and physical violence. Despite these threats, let’s celebrate that God’s Word is reaching families like this one:

*“We are grateful to the Lord to receive relevant themes for our daily walk with God. We believe these programs are very important for growing in our faith. And for those who don’t know Him yet, they are an invitation to find the truth. This is our wish, our prayer, that the truth be known by more people here and for more people to bow at the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”*

What a great prayer, let’s join him using Philippians 2:10-11 as our guide:

*Father, thank You for Jesus whose name is above every other. We pray one day He will be praised in* *Kyrgyzstan* *and every nation, every language, and every tongue throughout heaven and earth. As Your Word goes out, may it turn hard hearts and heads towards Him. Help us to reflect His glory in the way we treat people today. May our lips proclaim His truth and goodness, so others will be drawn to Him. In Jesus' name, amen.*

**Tomorrow, pray with us as God’s Word goes out in Uzbekistan.**
