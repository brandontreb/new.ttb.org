 Praying to forgive those we once despised

***“I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them.”*** *-Ezekiel 36: 26-27*

God’s church is expanding in Kosovo! From around 80 believers at the outbreak of war in 1998, now as many as 6% of Kosovar identify themselves as Christians. While churches are still young, a hunger for God’s Word is evident, and listeners like Elona are joining us on a regular basis. Here’s her story:

*“I live in Kosovo where the majority of people are Muslim. THRU the BIBLE is one of the programs which have helped a lot in my spiritual growth. I love going through each verse and chapter of the Bible with you. As we do, I’m getting to know more about the Lord, and my love and my obedience toward Him is growing. Thank you for your wonderful work. Please keep the people of Kosovo in your prayers. There is much tension, and only God can change their hearts.”*

It’s true—only God can bring about true and lasting change. Through an understanding of His forgiveness for us, we can begin to look at others in a new light and forgive those we once hated. So, as we thank God for the growth of His church in Kosovo, continue to pray He adds to their numbers. Through a relationship with Him and an understanding of His Word, may Kosovo become a peaceful and God-honoring nation.

**Our prayer journey continues on Monday in North America. Pack a sunhat and meet us on the white sandy beaches of Cancun.**
