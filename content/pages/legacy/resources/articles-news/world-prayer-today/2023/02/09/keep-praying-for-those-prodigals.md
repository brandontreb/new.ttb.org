 Keep praying for those prodigals

Have you been praying for a prodigal? Keep at it. God listens, He hears, and He cares. That’s the message we hear from a listener named Matteo in Honduras:

*“I began listening in Honduras when I was eight years old with my mother. Sadly, I went away from God for more than 20 years. I played at church, attending several, but my heart wasn’t in it and my life didn’t reflect a relationship with Him. At 41 years old, God has brought me back to His fold—an answer to my mother's fervent prayers. Unfortunately, she could not see it, since she went to be with the Lord in November 2017. But I know she is rejoicing.*

*“As I was looking for Bible studies to be built up in my Christian life, I found your website on the internet a week ago. I am very blessed by the program. I have started in the book of Genesis and plan to continue through to the end. I am grateful for your faithful service in God’s Word and for my mother’s persistence; I want to tell all of you that God does answer your prayers.”*

Be encouraged! As we cry out for those we love, we can be sure God is listening. Thank Him for the prayers of Matteo’s mother and pray with confidence he is hearing yours, too. Ask Him to give us patience to wait on His timing and faith to believe He is at work even when we cannot see it.

**God’s Word is overcoming obstacles in Cuba. Rejoice and pray with us tomorrow.**
