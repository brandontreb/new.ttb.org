 God patiently pursues us

***And they heard the sound of the******Lord******God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the******Lord******God among the trees of the garden.******Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, “Where are you?”*** -Genesis 3:8-9

From the very beginning, God has pursued us. When Adam and Eve sinned, God still sought them out. That’s also the story Jamal from Morocco shared with us:

*“I’m a carpenter. One day while repairing furniture I came across a small book about Luke. I asked the homeowner about it. He responded infidels gave it to him while he was traveling abroad. Something triggered in my heart, but I didn’t give it much thought.* 

*“A week after that, I was sitting browsing through my phone and was strangely reminded of the book. So, I started browsing for the Bible and Christianity, and a program called THRU the BIBLE caught my ears. I began to focus on it and was surprised by the depth of what I was hearing. I put it aside and then two months later I listened again and have never stopped. That day I called the number at the end of the program. Through your sincere follow up and patience with my questions and doubts (along with what God was doing in my heart), I knew what I needed to do. I declared that Jesus is Lord and I asked Him to cleanse me from my sin. I am thankful for God’s patience with me as I slowly turned to Him. I am now a Christ follower, and I cannot wait to see His work in my life.”*

God’s passionate pursuit of us involved sending His beloved Son to die in our place (see John 3:16–18 and 2 Corinthians 5:21; 9:15). Because we could not reach Him through our own efforts, He reached down to us. Thank Him for that in your life, in Jamal’s, and in the lives of all those coming to faith in Him as they ride the Bible Bus with us. Share your salvation story with someone today and share your gratitude with Him for His patient pursuit of you, too.

**How has God used the circumstances in your life to bring you closer to Him? A listener in India shares her story tomorrow. Join us as we praise and pray.**
