 Pray for all to have access

How do you listen to THRU the BIBLE? By app, online, on your favorite radio station, on Alexa, or YouTube? For many of us, the options are abundant. But for others, gaining access to THRU the BIBLE (or any Bible-based teaching) can be difficult. That’s what we hear from a listener of our Mandarin programs:

*“Your programs are very helpful to me. Thanks for your service in the Lord. I am growing spiritually and have become dependent on your teaching, but sometimes we cannot hear them. I do not know if this is intentional interference by men or if it’s just the delicate service that a ministry like this requires. Either way I am praying you are heard easily around the world.”*

What a great prayer. Today join this gentleman in praying for God’s Word as it goes out today. May no resistance (either man-made or due to lack of infrastructure) be a hindrance to His name being shared and His glory seen around the world. 

**Wherever God’s Word is heard, in whatever language, may it bring glory to His name. That’s what we’re praying tomorrow. We’ll meet you in China.**
