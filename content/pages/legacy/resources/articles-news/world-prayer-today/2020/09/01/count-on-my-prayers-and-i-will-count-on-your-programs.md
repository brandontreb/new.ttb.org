 “Count on my prayers, and I will count on your programs”


September 01, 2020

*“Count on my prayers, and I will count on your programs.”* 

 That’s what we hear from Joaquin, a fellow prayer warrior in Ecuador. Here’s his story: 

 *“I thank all of you who prepare this Bible study in the Quichua language, and all those who pray for it. I work as a night watchman in the hospital until 6 a.m. Every morning your study is like a good breakfast. I have been listening to you for many years, but I never tire of learning. I promise I will continue listening to you because God’s Word gives me what I need to live this life and prepare for the next.”* 

 God’s family is expanding in Ecuador. Today praise Him for believers like Joaquin who want to deepen their faith, and pray for trained pastors to meet the need of growing churches. 

 **Ready for another adventure? Join us tomorrow as we pray our way through the rain forests and growing cities of Guyana.**
