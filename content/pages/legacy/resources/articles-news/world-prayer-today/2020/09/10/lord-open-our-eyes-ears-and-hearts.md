 Lord, open our eyes, ears, and hearts

***Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things from Your law.*** -Psalm 119:18 

 *“**I pray every day as I listen to you. I start by asking God to open my eyes, open my ears, and open my heart.”* 

 That’s what Rahul, a listener in Maharashtra, tells us. Here’s his story:

*“I first found your programs when I listened to a lot of music while doing homework. I would sit at my desk and continually change the frequency looking for the next song I liked. One day I couldn’t find anything but heard a voice that sounded good. As I listened to the message, I was touched and also encouraged to listen to the program again. Slowly it became my favorite. I accepted Jesus as my Savior and after completing my studies, I went to Bible college for two years. I have opened a small church and tell my church family to listen to you as well.”*

Today as we pray for this local pastor and all those sharing God’s Word in India, ask God to open our eyes, ears, and hearts too. As His Word goes out, may people come to know and serve Him with a passion like this man following Jesus Christ by faith in a harsh culture.
