 Praying for spiritual dependence in Finland


June 08, 2020

Finland is wild beauty mixed with contemporary design—that’s what we’ll discover as we touch down in Helsinki, the capital city. 


Welcome, World Prayer Team, we’ve got a lot to intercede for today. While over 84% of people identify themselves as Christians, fewer than 8% of Finns claim to attend any kind of religious service every month, and only 3% go weekly. As with many industrialized nations, secularism, intellectualism, hedonism, and materialism dominate the thinking and politics of Finland. 


So, today let’s pray that God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* creates a spiritual hunger in the hearts and homes of Finns in big cities and small towns alike. May the people of Finland turn back to the Lord and, despite their pride in independence, realize their need to completely rely on the Lord. 


Pray Psalm 105:1-4 over Finland: 


Oh, give thanks to the Lord!  

Call upon His name;  

Make known His deeds among the peoples!  

Sing to Him, sing psalms to Him;  

Talk of all His wondrous works!  

Glory in His holy name;  

Let the hearts of those rejoice who seek the Lord!  

Seek the Lord and His strength;  

Seek His face evermore! 


**Tomorrow’s stop: Norway. Join us as we travel there on our knees.**
