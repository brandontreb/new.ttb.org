 “I fall in love with God’s Word more each day.”

“I fall in love with God’s Word more each day.”


Welcome, World Prayer Team, that’s the good news we hear from a listener named Aaron in Senegal. He continues:


*“My family is Muslim and do not know that I listen to your teaching. I found your programs in my language of Pular, and I listen daily. At first I was upset that it was so different from what I was taught, but each day I learn something new that lingers in my mind. Please send me a Bible. Thank you for all you do.”*


Praise God! Today let’s pray for all Muslims in Senegal and Western Africa to hear God’s Word and be changed. While we’re at it, let’s also lift up Sankare Adramane, *Thru the Bible’s* producer in the language of Pular, as he follows up with listeners like Aaron in this difficult region.


**Tomorrow we’ll be praying for God’s Word to change lives in Niger. Hop aboard and join us.**
