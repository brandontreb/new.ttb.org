 Praying for God’s Word heard in Lingala


March 27, 2020
![]()




Formerly known as Zaire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) is now named after the immense Congo River. 


Home to more than 200 people groups, linguistically the DR Congo is one of the most diverse (and likely hardest to reach) countries in the world.


That’s exactly why in recent years *Thru the Bible* began airing God’s Word in the language of Lingala and is actively looking to expand our reach in other local languages.


Pray today for God to transform hearts through His Word. With each message that airs on *Thru the Bible*, pray God will be glorified and a revival will be ignited in the Congolese people. Ask God to bless Barnabe Muanda, *Thru the Bible’s* voice in Lingala—who suffers with pain in his eyes and headaches. May Barnabe and those working alongside him experience God’s tender mercies and favor as they serve Him each day.


**Your partnership in prayer is needed again on Monday, join us as we travel on our knees to Oceania.**
