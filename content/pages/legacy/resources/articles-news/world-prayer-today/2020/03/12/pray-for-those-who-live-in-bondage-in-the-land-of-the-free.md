 Pray for those who live in bondage in the “Land of the Free”

***“******And you shall know the******truth, and the truth shall make you free.”*** -John 8:32 


Welcome, Prayer Team. Our journey today brings us to Thailand. Translated, Thailand literally means “Land of the Free.” Yet as we travel on our knees, we quickly discover many here live in bondage. As one listener recently wrote: 


*“I am a Buddhist, yet I have never experienced real joy. The confines of my religion often make me feel imprisoned. When a neighbor told me I could find freedom and joy in Jesus Christ, I was curious. He invited me to join your study of the Bible. Now that I listen, I feel you know the way to true and lasting contentment. This seems strange but true. I will keep listening and hope that you will enlighten me on how I can become a Christian and realize joy in my life.”*


Praise God for His Word being taught on *Thru the Bible* in the Thai language. God promised His Word would always accomplish what He wants—and He wants more people in Thailand and around the world to discover His truth and the freedom of our souls set free from sin and death. Thank you for partnering in prayer for this wonderful goal.  


**We’ll pray tomorrow in Cambodia. Travel with us.**
