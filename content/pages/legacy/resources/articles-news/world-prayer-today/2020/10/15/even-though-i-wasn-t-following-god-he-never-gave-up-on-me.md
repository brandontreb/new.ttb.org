 “Even though I wasn’t following God, He never gave up on me …”

*“He never gave up on me.”* 

 That’s the good news we hear from Ananya who studies God’s Word with us in her language of Malayalam in India. Here’s more of her story:  

 *“I grew up in a non-Christian family, but I attended a Christian school. When I married, my husband and I practiced the rituals of our family religion, but in my heart, I never forgot about the commitment I made to God as a girl. My husband met many Christians and did not like them, so he forbade me from visiting a church or reading the Bible.* 

*“A few years ago, a neighbor invited me to attend the Bible study at her home. After years of longing to hear God’s Word, I went—even though I knew my husband wouldn’t be happy. That’s when I heard about you. I studied more, and I began to realize that even though I wasn’t following God, He never gave up on me and was waiting for me to come back. It was Him who was calling my heart back to Him since I was a child. What a revelation!* 

*“Now I listen to you every morning and it feeds my soul. My husband still forbids me from attending church, but he permits me to listen to* Thru the Bible *and I still quietly visit my neighbor. Thank you for being my church and helping me grow in faith.”* 

 It’s true, God is patient and never gives up on us. Thank Him today for how He uses *Thru the Bible* to draw listeners to Himself like this sweet sister and others in India and throughout the world. Pray their hearts are softened and they come to Him by faith through a relationship with His Son, Jesus. 

 **Join us tomorrow as we pray for God’s Word to break through hard spiritual soil in the state of Gujarat.**
