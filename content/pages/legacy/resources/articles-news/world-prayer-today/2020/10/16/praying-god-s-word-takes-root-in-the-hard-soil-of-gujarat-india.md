 Praying God’s Word takes root in the hard soil of Gujarat, India


October 16, 2020

Hard soil. That’s how many describe the spiritual landscape in Kutch district in the Indian state of Gujarat.

That’s why *Thru the Bible* is committed to reaching the more than 885,000 people who speak the Kutchi language—and it’s working. As one listener tells us, 

*“I started to listen to your Kutchi program with a group of people in my area. We are truly grateful that you lead us in this study of the Bible. Through these studies I am now a Christian and trying to reach others. There aren’t many of us here. Please pray that God helps us win over more Kutchi people through our Home Group.”*

That’s a great request. Today, let’s intercede for God’s Word to be heard in every home in Gujarat and beyond. Pray His truth is taught and brings many to believe the good news He has for each of them.

Do you know someone who needs to hear the good news? We can help. Download Dr. McGee’s free booklet, [“God So Loved.”](/docs/default-source/booklets/ttb_god-so-loved.pdf?sfvrsn=1a191f16_2)

**On Monday, a college student in the USA tell us how God reached him. Join us and pray for your family and friends at TTB.org.**
