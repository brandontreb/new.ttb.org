 Does life seem out of control? A listener in India reminds us, “God is with us.”

***“Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the Lord your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you.”*** -Deuteronomy 31:6  

 If 2020 has taught us anything, it’s that we have no control over what’s going to happen next. Thankfully those of us who walk with the Lord know even when circumstances seem out of control, we can trust Him. And, that’s exactly what we hear from a listener who is part of one of *Thru the Bible’s* Home Groups in Andhra Pradesh. 

 *“Although I’m a Christian, my family forced me to marry into a family of non-believers. My husband is an alcoholic and has a short temper, which made my life very upsetting. I now read the Bible without him seeing, listen to your programs, and meet quietly with other women who listen as well. Even though my husband hasn’t changed, this program strengthens my faith and shows me God’s grace in spite of the struggles. Book by book, God’s Word strengthens me. The study of Deuteronomy in the Old Testament reminds me of God’s faithfulness for the long term. No matter what we do, He is with us. I’m so thankful for this reminder each day as I open His Word.”* 

 Are you grateful for the steadfast love of God? Thank Him for His grace in your life and the lives of all those who join us in studying His Word. Please remember to lift up this listener today and pray for all those who need to be reminded of His faithfulness. Your neighbor? A friend? Perhaps even a family member? What about you? In the midst of the known and difficult, may God’s Word be a refuge, and like the Israelites in Deuteronomy may we be reminded that He will never abandon us.
