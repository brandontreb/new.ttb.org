 “I lost a lot of time focusing on problems instead of looking to God …”

Today we’re traveling through Indonesia praying for the 34 million Sunda who live in West Java. 

Professing Islam, but highly influenced by animism and traditional beliefs, the Sunda are one of the largest unreached people groups in the world. But God’s Word, heard on *Thru the Bible*, is making inroads. A listener, Yohnes, recently called with this update:  
  
*“Life is full of challenges and trials. I was a very angry man, but as I listened to your program, I began to see God’s blessings in my life. I now believe God is always close to me. Each morning I sit with you and increase my knowledge about Jesus’ love for His people. I also try to share about God with my friends and neighbors. Most won’t listen, but some have begun to listen with me. Please keep me in your prayers. I lost a lot of time focusing on problems instead of looking to God for answers. I do not wish anyone else to do the same.”*

It’s for people like Yohnes that we pray together every day. Be encouraged and keep praying for God’s Word to take root in the lives of Sunda people—and all our hearts!

**Join us tomorrow as we travel on our knees to the restrictive and secretive country of Myanmar.**
