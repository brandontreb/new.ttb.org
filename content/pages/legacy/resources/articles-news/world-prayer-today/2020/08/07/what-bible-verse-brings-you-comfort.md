 What Bible verse brings you comfort?


August 07, 2020

***As for God, His way is perfect;******the word of the Lord is proven; He is a shield to all who trust in Him.*** -2 Samuel 22:31

When you are afraid, what Bible verse comforts you? Isaiah 41:10 or Psalm 46:1? There are so many good ones!

As we pray our way through the Philippines today, we meet with a listener who tells her story and shares the verse she relies on.

*“Thank you for everything. God’s Word is the source of our strength, especially in the lingering trials in our lives. You help understand and give us encouragement we really need. Because of you, we can cope with whatever pains we may have through our everyday listening. After an especially hard day, I find myself repeating 2 Samuel 22:31 over and over. As God’s Word seeps in, the burdens of life slowly become lighter without me being aware of it.”*

Praise God for the way He uses His Word in our lives. As His Word is taught on *Thru the Bible* today, pray many more in the Philippines will discover the strength He offers us and chose to trust Him.

**We’ve got a lot to pray about Monday in Equatorial Guinea; invite a friend to join us.**
