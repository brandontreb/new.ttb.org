 Praying for a sister in Assam, India


August 17, 2020

Assam, India, is known for its national parks abounding with wildlife, its archeological sites, and well-manicured tea plantations. But many also call this region “the major spiritual challenge” in India. After more than 200 years of Christian work, the number of professing Christians is small and marginalized.

Welcome, World Prayer Team, as we touch down in the capital city of Dispur. Here a listener named Reenu tells us how God’s Word has changed her life and asks us to pray for her countrymen. She says:

*“Your messages have introduced me to God, and I am growing in His Word. I now invite others to my home to listen with me. Many say what a blessing it is to hear God’s Word in our language of Assamese. We pray and worship the Lord together. Please pray for God’s Word to reach all of Assam and for people to leave their idols and traditional ways of life and turn to the Good News of Jesus Christ.”*

What a great request. As we praise God for Reenu’s faith, let’s also pray His Word will open the ears of others in Assam and throughout the world who are ready to listen.

**Join us tomorrow as our journey takes us Southwest to pray for *Thru the Bible* in the language** **of Kannada.**
