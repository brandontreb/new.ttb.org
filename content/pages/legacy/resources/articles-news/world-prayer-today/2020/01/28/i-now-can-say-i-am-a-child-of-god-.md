 “I now can say I am a child of God.”


January 28, 2020
![]()




Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we travel to Western Europe and meet a couple of our fellow listeners.


Fady in Germany greets us with these words: *“Wow, a program worth more than pearls! This program fills my spiritual hunger and gives me peace and understanding with God. I have been listening to* Thru the Bible *in Arabic for several years and now can say I am a child of God.”*


And Giampaolo in Italy shares this: *“I discovered your program a couple of months ago. God led me to it. Just now I decided to give to Him my life and all my praise. Thanks for the work you do for the radio and above all for God!”*


Despite this good news, we have a lot to pray about. 


Begin by asking for God’s will to be done in people’s lives in Western Europe. 


Pray that as life’s circumstances make it obvious people need Jesus, that they would be receptive to hear the Good News. 


Ask the Lord to provide willing Christians to see and respond to opportunities to begin a conversation about what it means to know God. Thank the Lord that these people’s paths cross.


Thank the Lord people now have different mediums on which they can hear *Thru the Bible*. Pray now that they will tune in. 


Pray for *Thru the Bible* broadcasts in Arabic, English, Czech, Dutch, Flemish, French, German, Low German, and Italian. (Is one of these your family’s heritage? Pray for that one!) May God’s will be done and someday soon, “For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea” (Habakkuk 2:14).


**We’re praying for pastors in Southern Africa tomorrow—you’re not going to want to miss it.**
