 A group of lepers in India are praying for you…

*“Hope was hard to find, but then I heard God’s Word and everything changed.”* That’s what a listener of *Thru the Bible* in India recently shared. Here’s the rest of his story.


*“Six years ago, I was affected by leprosy and quarantined. There I lived with 10 families, 30 of us in total. It was difficult at first, but one day a new member was admitted and suggested we listen to* Jindagi Ke Radda [*Thru the Bible* in the language of Chhattisgarhi] *and then we all prayed together. It was a life-changing moment for many of us.  

  

“This program has helped me to know more about the Lord Jesus Christ, and in-depth study of His Word has developed my faith in Him. I am affected by leprosy, but I believe the Word of God has healed me spiritually. I want to thank God and you for speaking the Word of God through radio, which has changed the lives of so many patients, including me. We are healed through His love and believe His will for our lives is greater than we can imagine. We pray for you and all those who pray for us. To God be the glory for what He is doing in our lives.”*


Praise God for the power of His Word. Like these listeners, may everyone in Chhattisgarh and around the world learn to trust in His plan and believe in His goodness in our lives.


**The journey continues tomorrow as we travel through Nepal.**
