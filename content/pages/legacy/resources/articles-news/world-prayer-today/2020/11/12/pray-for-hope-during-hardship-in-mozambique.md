 Pray for hope during hardship in Mozambique

**The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer;** **my God, mystrength, in whom I will trust; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.**  -Psalm 18:2

The trip of a lifetime. That’s how many travelers describe their time in Mozambique. With a long Indian Ocean coastline dotted with popular beaches, turquoise ocean water, and colonial-era ruins surviving from a period of Portuguese rule, it’s easy to see why. 

Our journey through Eastern Africa continues today, beginning in the capital city of Maputo. As we tour the city and beyond, we’re reminded of what we’ve seen on our travels before: living in Mozambique is difficult. In addition to the violence between the government and national resistance groups, extreme poverty, malnourishment, malaria, and HIV/AIDS plague the people. But here in the midst of hardships, God’s Word is reaching listeners like this one:

*“I was experiencing great anxiety because of the worldwide pandemic. We already have so many problems, I felt like this was the crushing blow. I was scared and needed refuge. That’s when a neighbor suggested your teaching. These are difficult times, but listening to your beautiful words renewed my faith. My hope was reborn, and I have realized God is my rock. He is my strength, and I trust Him completely. Thank you for the peace you have brought to my heart.”* 

Praise God for His Word that reminds us He is trustworthy. As we pray today for the many physical needs of the people of Mozambique, lift up their spiritual needs as well. As God’s Word is taught on *Thru the Bible*, may many more realize the truths found in Psalm 18:2. 

God can be your rock, too, no matter what is going on in your life. Learn more about His care in difficult days by downloading Dr. McGee’s digital booklet, [“How to Have Peace in Anxious Times.”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_how-to-have-peace-in-anxious-times.pdf?sfvrsn=ff351e16_2)

**It’s a joy to have you along for the journey. Join tomorrow as we pray for pastors in Zimbabwe.**
