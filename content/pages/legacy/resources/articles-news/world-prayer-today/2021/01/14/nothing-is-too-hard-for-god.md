 Nothing is too hard for God

**“Ah, Lord God! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You.”** -Jeremiah 32:17 

 *“I received a radio from you a year ago. Since then I have listened to your programs. At first I was shocked by what I heard.”* 

 That’s what Enkhmaa in Mongolia tells us as we travel through Eastern Asia today. She continues her story: 

 *“In school, I learned about Darwin’s Revolutionary Theory and how humans descended from a monkey. From you I learned how God created the world and everything in it. I learned that I am His child and He loves me. This knowledge changed my worldview. My attitude in life has become more positive, and I have hope. Thank you for sharing the truth about God.”* 

 More than a quarter of the world’s population live in Eastern Asia. Pray each one hears the truth about God in a language they can understand. While the task may seem great, Jeremiah 32:17 reminds us that nothing is too hard for God. 

 **Northern Africa can be hard soil for the gospel. Pray with us tomorrow as we travel on our knees through Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Western Sahara, and Tunisia.**
