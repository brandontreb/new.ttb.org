 The difference between religion and relationship

The Aurora Borealis, the Midnight Sun, or polar nights—a trip to Northern Europe is sure to impress even the most seasoned of travelers.

So, as we make our way through Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, we praise God for the sights and sounds in this glorious region of His creation and meet with a fellow Bible Bus traveler named Marianne from Norway. She tells us:

*“I have listened to* Thru the Bible *since 2016. First on Norwegian radio, now on your app and internet radio. Dr. McGee is a great blessing to me and has helped me grow as a Christian. I have been lifted up in troubled times. I am the only Christian in my family and pray for others to join me.* 

*“They do not understand my commitment and think me odd, but I continue to pray. I thank you for the work you do. Please join me in praying my family and more people in my country will understand the difference between a religion and having a vibrant and growing relationship. It feels as though there are very few that follow Him with their lives.”*

Can you relate to her request? As we praise God for the steadfast faith of this sister, let’s remember the family members and friends of all those who listen to *THRU the BIBLE*. May they too hear the truth and come to a saving relationship with our living Lord.

**Travel with us to California tomorrow as we celebrate God’s goodness and saving grace in all our lives.**
