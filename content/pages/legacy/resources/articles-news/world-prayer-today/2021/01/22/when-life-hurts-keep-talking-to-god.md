 When life hurts, keep talking to God

**Cast your burden on the****Lord****,** **and He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.** -Psalm 55:22 

 Boasting 16 countries, West Africa is about the size of the continental United States but home to 40 million more people. Though the geographic regions vary greatly, the hearts of those devoted to God’s Word are all beautiful.  

 Welcome to World Prayer Today. As we travel on our knees through the many countries of West Africa, we stop in Nigeria to sit beside a listener named Kemi who shares her deep sadness and asks us to pray.  

 *“I was given the gift of a baby, but she passed away. I wasn’t sure I wanted to live after she died. Since then I’ve waited for God to bless me with another child, but He has not answered. My husband grew impatient and added another wife to our family. She has birthed many children. I live in agony. Please pray for me. Your programs in my language of Hausa are the only things that encourage me. I listen to God’s Word and pray. I feel my life will never have joy again and worry that my husband will discard me. I’m trying to the trust the Lord, but it is difficult when my heart is overwhelmed with grief.”*

Today pray for all those who are heartbroken and need a reminder that God’s love is unfailing, and His power is more than enough for whatever we need. As they offer Him their heartaches, may His peace and joy be theirs.

Where do you turn when life hurts? Psalm 55:22 reminds us to keep talking to God and to trust Him. It’s hard, but He promises to hold us up. To learn more about what God’s Word says about our pain, download Dr. McGee’s free booklet, [“Why Do God’s Children Suffer?”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_why-do-god-39-s-children-suffer.pdf?sfvrsn=79ff1e16_2)

**On Monday, we’re praying for unsaved family members as we travel through Northern Europe. Invite your friends to join us at [TTB.org/pray.](http://www.TTB.org/pray)**
