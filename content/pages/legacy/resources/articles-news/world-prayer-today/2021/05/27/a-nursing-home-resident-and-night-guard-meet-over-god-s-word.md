 A nursing home resident and night guard meet over God’s Word

*“There aren’t many Christians in the nursing home where I live, but I have an ally in a young night guard who helps me hear your program on the internet.”*

That’s what we hear from Kyeta, a regular aboard the Bible Bus in the Czech Republic. As she tells the rest of her story, thank God for the “family” you’ve inherited as one of His children.

*“Each night as the hallways become quiet, Alexandr comes to my room and helps me pull* Thru the Bible *up on my computer. I used to be able to do it on my own, but after a stroke I have trouble remembering a lot of things. At first, he would pull it up and leave, but now we listen together. Our hearts have been knitted together in God’s Word, and he has become a family member to me. His visits and listening to you are the highlight of my day. I send you many greetings and pray each of you go to sleep snuggled in God’s palm every day as do I.”*

That’s our prayer for you, too. May God draw you close and let you rest in the knowledge of His love. 

**This joyful journey continues tomorrow in Latvia. It wouldn’t be the same without you, please hop aboard.**
