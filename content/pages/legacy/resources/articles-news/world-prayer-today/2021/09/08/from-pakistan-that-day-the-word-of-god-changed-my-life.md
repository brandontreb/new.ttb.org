 From Pakistan: “That day the Word of God changed my life.”

Today’s stop on our journey brings us back to Pakistan, a nation we’ve prayed for quite a bit.

If you recall from previous visits, it’s difficult to be a Christian in Pakistan. Over 95% of Pakistanis are Sunni Muslims, many of them extreme in their views. Violent persecution against Christians is common, forcing many believers to meet and worship in secret. 

Yet God’s Word heard on THRU the BIBLE is taking root through home groups. As one listener tells us:

*“I am a student in the city of Lahore. There were many worldly things in my life before I accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior. I was not comfortable with any of it. One day a neighbor invited me to a home group near my house, and I heard about Jesus. After we listened to your message, the leader helped me understand more* *about how Jesus died and rose from the dead to save us. That day the Word of God changed my life.*

*“I repented from all my sins and promised to leave my sins behind. At the age of about 18, I was baptized in water. Now I have the wonderful experience of surety that I am a saved person. I spend time with God regularly and read His Word daily. From all I have learned from you, I now teach the children of our group.”*

Praise God that despite the barriers, His Word is changing lives in Lahore and throughout Pakistan. As THRU THE BIBLE goes out today, pray more in this Muslim-dominant nation will hear the name of Jesus and be brought to their knees by the power of His love and grace.

**God is in the business of answering prayers. Join us for a great story tomorrow as we travel to Odisha.**
