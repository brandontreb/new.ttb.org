 From Lithuania: “I want to do things correctly in God’s eyes.”

*“Turn your life over to the Spirit of God. Yield to Him, and let Him do for you what you can’t do for yourself.”* -Dr. J. Vernon McGee

As our prayer journey through eastern Europe continues, we stop today and visit with Steponas who joins us on the Bible Bus in Lithuania. He says:

*“I listen to your Bible programs, and I think about my faith—do I understand it correctly? I am trying to live a right life, but I still doubt if my understanding of things is correct and wonder if I make my decisions right (I am a businessman). As I listen and read, will you pray for me? I worry and want to do things correctly in God’s eyes.”*

Do you or someone you know struggle with the same concerns? God’s Word tells us we can’t do it alone. Thankfully the Holy Spirit is ready and able to help. Read Romans 8 today and ask the Holy Spirit to lead and guide all of us on the Bible Bus as we seek to live lives that please Him.

**Does God really forget and forgive our sins? Find out tomorrow as we pray through Poland.**
