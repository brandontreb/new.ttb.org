 Does God really forget and forgive our sins?


September 24, 2021

*“God has put our sins behind His back, and He won’t turn around. When we come to the living God and repent, He forgives and forgets.**”* -Dr. J. Vernon McGee

*“I feel like a failure.”* That’s what we hear today as we visit with one of THRU the BIBLE’s listeners in central Poland. His story continues: 

*“I appreciate your letters and prayers more than you know. I have changed my approach to life, but I still struggle with forgiving myself. I have tried to fill my mind with God’s Word, yet I still dwell on the bad decisions that led me to this prison. Your counsel has been a revelation. I am committing Philippians 3 to memory, and I agree* *we can’t be living with one leg in the past life and a second leg in the new one; we have to choose.”*

Today let’s thank God for this listener and the reminder that His Word encourages us to press on and to move forward. Pray today that we forget what is behind us and focus on what lies ahead as we serve Jesus Christ.  

While we’re on our knees, pray for THRU the BIBLE’S Polish team as they respond to the many letters, emails, texts, and phone calls like this one. Ask God to multiply their ministry and encourage them as they tirelessly share His love and grace with all those who speak the Polish language.

**Next week we begin an exciting journey of praise and prayer through western Africa. We’ve got a lot to pray about in Liberia on Monday.**
