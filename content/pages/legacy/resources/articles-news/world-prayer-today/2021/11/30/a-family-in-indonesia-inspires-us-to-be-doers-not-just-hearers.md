 A family in Indonesia inspires us to be doers, not just hearers

***But be doers of the word, and not hearers only …***  -James 1:22

God hears our prayers and is faithful to answer! Need proof? Take heart in this text from a family in Indonesia. 

 *“I thought your programs were strange at first, but through them I learned that Jesus’ teaching is about love. I decided my family needed this kind of love in our lives, and we decided to trust in God. Now we do not only want to be listeners, but we want to be doers. We want to be light and salt and dare to fight our lust. Praise the Lord I can do His will. I can watch my heart, my mind, and my lips, but it’s not easy. The Holy Spirit will help me.”* 

 Praise God for those who hear His Word and become authentic followers of Jesus. Today thank Him for His Spirit who gives us the wisdom to live a life that pleases God. 

 **There is a lot more to thank God for. Meet us here tomorrow, and we’ll travel on our knees to Georgia.**
