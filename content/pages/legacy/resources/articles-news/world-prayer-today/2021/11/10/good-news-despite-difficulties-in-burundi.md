 Good news despite difficulties in Burundi


November 10, 2021

With its soaring mountains and relaxed lakeside communities, Burundi’s charms are enticing. However, ethnic violence continues to render the country dangerous, and most tourists steer clear.

Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we pray our way through a country most of us will likely never visit in person, we learn that although 90% of Burundians identify themselves as Christian, syncretism and false teachings have threatened the gospel, though its truth stands. Widespread fighting has forced most Bible schools to close, leaving the nation with few trained leaders and pastors. Pray today for those who work tirelessly for God’s Word to be heard on THRU the BIBLE, and ask Him to reach more listeners like these with truth:

Alain tells us: *“My friends and I like listening to together. We find it is a great Bible school. We often quiz each other on what we are learning and remind one another of the truths found in God’s Word.”*

And Jeanne texted to say: *“Praise the Lord! I live in Bujumbura, the capital city. Your teachings are really heart touching. Please pray for me; I need to be totally transformed by the Word of God. Until now my heart was hardened, but now it is softening. I want to live only for Jesus now.”*

And Fabrice writes: *“Please pray for me. I am a Christian but have some sins which keep coming in my life even though I do not like them. So, I doubt if I can really be forgiven and strengthened by the Holy Spirit to overcome them. May God bless you so much.”*

**Meet us tomorrow in Mozambique as a listener named John tells us why Psalm 62 is important to him.**
