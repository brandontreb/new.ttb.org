 Praying Matthew 19:26 for our prodigals

***“With men this is impossible, but******with God all things are possible.”*** -Matthew 19:26

*“I have a difficult prayer request for you.”*

That’s the start of a letter we received from a listener of THRU the BIBLE in Azerbaijan. Here’s the rest of her email:

*“I am 71 years old and love your programs. My heart, however, is broken because my son, Artashes, has abandoned his family and been in Russia for many years. Please pray his heart softens to God and he restores his relationships with those he has hurt, especially his children.”*

Today as we pray for Artashes to return to the Lord and his family, let’s thank God for His promise in Matthew 19:26 and pray for all those within our families and communities that are waiting for the return of a loved one.

*Father, we’re grateful for Your love that doesn’t give up. Thank you that even though it seems like nothing can possibly change the hearts of those who have turned from You (and from their families), we know that with You, ALL things are possible. We entrust our beloved brothers and sisters to You and ask that You once again turn their eyes to You and keep them on You. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

**A listener in Jordan bravely follows Jesus. Hear her story tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
