 A unique prayer from Belgium


October 25, 2021
![]()




When you join us in praying for God’s whole Word to reach His whole world, how do you pray? A listener in Belgium tells us of his unique prayer.

*“I found you by accident as I Googled ‘French radio programs.’ I was quite surprised when your name came up. Out of unexplained curiosity, I began to listen and then listened to another program and then another. It’s been months now, and it has transformed my thinking and my way of life. I now consider myself a Christian and yearn to know more and more about the God of the Bible. As each program ends, I pray more people find your name as it comes up in search engines and begin to listen. I ask God to override man’s electronic expertise and use it in the way He sees fit to bring more people in Belgium to Himself.”*

Isn’t that great? Sounds like the Holy Spirit at work. Pray with this listener that God uses technology and “unexplained” curiosity to draw more listeners in Belgium to Himself.

**Join us tomorrow as we pray for God’s Word to sweep across the lush countryside of Ireland.**
