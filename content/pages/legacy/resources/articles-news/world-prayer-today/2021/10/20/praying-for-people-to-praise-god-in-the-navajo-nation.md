 Praying for people to praise God in the Navajo Nation


October 20, 2021
![]()




Our prayer tour through the United States continues today as we return to the Navajo Nation in western New Mexico, southeastern Utah, and northern Arizona.

As we recall from previous visits, alcohol abuse, unemployment, broken families, and suicide are difficult realities that many Navajo (or *Dine’* as they call themselves) face, and cultural barriers keep many from opening their hearts to the eternal life offered through a relationship with Jesus. And while we don’t receive many responses from those who listen to THRU the BIBLE in this area, we know God is at work. 

Together let’s pray Psalm 67:3-5 and ask that every man, woman, and child who lives in this region will come to sing His praise and shout for joy at His name.

*Heavenly Father, may the people praise you;* *may all the Navajo people praise you.May the entire Navajo nation be glad and sing for joy, for You rule the peoples with equity and guide the nations of the earth. As Your Word goes out, may the people praise you, God. Amen.*

**Grab your flip flops and a wide-brimmed hat. Tomorrow we’ll take in the seas and sunshine as we pray our way through the U.S. Virgin Islands.**
