 “God’s Word is evergreen”

***“I will never leave you nor forsake you.”*** -Hebrews 13:5 

*“Thank you for sharing God’s Word. I never tire of it or you. God’s Word is evergreen. So is a good salvation story, here’s mine.”*

That’s the beginning of an email we recently received from Honza in Czechia. He continues*:*

*“More than 40 years ago, my family sent me to Germany. I was destitute and often walked the streets without a place to stay. I would look through the trash that others tossed away. One night I found an old radio. I turned it on, and it worked! Later I was surfing, looking for some music, and heard your program in my native language of Czech.* 

*“Your voice took me home that night in my mind, and ultimately as I listened more you brought me home to Jesus as I placed my faith in Him. Thank you for your faithful service. God’s Word met me in my greatest moment of need, and I pray the same is true for more young people in Czechia.”*

That’s a great prayer, let’s join him. In a country where more than 40% profess atheism, praise God He saved Honza more than 40 years ago and is still doing the same today. 

**We’re praying our way through the big cities and romantic river valleys of Germany. See you there tomorrow.**
