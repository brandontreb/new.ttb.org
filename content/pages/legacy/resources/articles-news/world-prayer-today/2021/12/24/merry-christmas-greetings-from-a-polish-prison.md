 Merry Christmas greetings from a Polish prison

***“And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”*** -Matthew 1:21

If you’ve traveled the world praying with us this year, you’ve certainly seen evidence of the truth of Matthew 1:21 in countries and cities all over the globe. Today let’s add one more unlikely story to that list; here’s one from Jakub in Poland.

*“I’m a prisoner, and my life is filled with endless routines and boredom. One day a fellow worker was sick, and we both were quarantined. I was angry and spent much time telling my fellow inmate so. He always laughed and continued to read his books and listen to his programs. It was as if he enjoyed even more time in a small space with little to no break or interruptions to pass the time. Finally, I felt as if I was going to go out of my mind, so I asked if I could listen with him.   
  
“That’s when I heard that Jesus came to save from the sins of men … even a man like me. It changed everything. Now I study with you every day. The routine and structure of prison makes it easy for me to focus. I know on the outside I would be distracted, so I’m grateful for this time to learn and to become new. I am grateful to know Jesus and be transforming through His grace. This holiday season my quarantine friend and I plan to hold a couple services here. Please pray for us.”*

Merry Christmas, World
Prayer Team. As you celebrate the birth of our Savior and God’s grace in our
lives, thank Him for Jakub and all those who have joined us on the Bible Bus in
2021. Together let’s pray more people around the world will learn and love
God’s Word in 2022.

**A Muslim with three wives is our new brother in faith. Hear his incredible story on Monday.**
