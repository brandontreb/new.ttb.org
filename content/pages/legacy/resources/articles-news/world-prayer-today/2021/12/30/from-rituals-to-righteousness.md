 From rituals to righteousness


December 30, 2021
![]()




As we walked through the pages of Mark with Dr. McGee, we saw Jesus’ miracle—casting demons out of a man in Capernaum. In this important story, we saw Jesus as God in the flesh—all powerful, in control, and here to save man from sin. This study was particularly important for one family in India. Here’s their story.

*“Before coming to the Lord, we used to practice animal sacrifice time to time. I was thinking that through all these rituals we will get rid of our sin. But when I started listening to your programs in the book of Mark, I realized all the rituals I was performing were completely useless and worthless.* 

*“The Word of God enlightened me. I started to trust Jesus for everything. Gradually my faith in Jesus was strong, and I trusted the free gift of salvation that only Jesus Christ can give us. Before we knew Jesus we were going through very tough times. Poverty was the main problem. We even didn’t have enough clothes to wear, and we barely survived. After Jesus entered into our lives, we became confident and began to prosper in all areas. Presently, we are living in a quite better condition and have time to share our newly found faith with our relatives and neighbors. A few of them started believing and accepted the Lord. We are beginning a church worship in our own house. Please pray for my family and especially for my children so that they will grow in the grace and knowledge of God’s Word.”*

Praise God His Word sets us straight. As you hop aboard the Bible Bus today, ask Him to use His Word in your life … to teach you to do what is right and correct you when you are wrong. 

**A listener in West Africa is learning to overcome doubt. Pray with us tomorrow.**
