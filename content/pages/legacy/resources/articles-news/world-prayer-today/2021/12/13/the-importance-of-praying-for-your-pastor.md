 The importance of praying for your pastor


December 13, 2021

How often do you pray for your pastor? This listener of THRU the BIBLE in the language of Umbundu reminds us that their struggles are much like our own:

*“God bless the works of your hands! I am a pastor in Angola, but my life is a mess. I am involved in alcohol, drugs, and sexual immorality. I am the one who leads the worship as well as preaching. I am ashamed of talking to one of my fellow brothers, but I recognize what I am doing is wrong. I thank God for* Thru the Bible, *which is convicting me and challenging me to repent, but I do not have courage to tell this matter to my congregation. Please help, I need your prayers and advice.”*

Today, thank God for His Word that guides and corrects us. Thank Him also for THRU the BIBLE’s Umbundu team who will respond to this pastor and all those who want to connect with us. May God give them wisdom and discernment as they reach out in His name.

***How is God’s Word guiding you and correcting you in big and small ways? We’d love to hear your story. Write to us at*** [**[email protected]**](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7a383338363f382f293a2e2e385415081d)***and meet us tomorrow in Ghana.***
