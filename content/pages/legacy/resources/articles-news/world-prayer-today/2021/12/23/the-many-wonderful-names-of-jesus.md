 The many wonderful names of Jesus

***For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father,******Prince of Peace.****-*Isaiah 9:6

On Tuesday, we listed some of the many things Jesus is to each of us. Did you perhaps jot down any of the wonderful names mentioned in Isaiah 9:6? A listener in Rwanda tells us one that comes to her mind often is Prince of Peace. Here’s why:

*“I was addicted to drugs and alcohol for years. My life was miserable, and I yearned for peace. Every day, I tried to find ways to change, and nothing worked. I tried other religions, and I always went back. But today,* *I am excited to tell you that I am no longer a slave of sin. Jesus saved me through the teachings on the* Thru the Bible *radio program! I am now enjoying this new journey, and I trust the Lord. My life is filled with peace, and I feel different than I ever have. He truly is the Prince of Peace … not only in the world, but also in my life. I praise God for this most amazing gift.”*

Yes! This season, praise God for the peace He gave to the world through the birth of His Son, Jesus, and for the peace we each experience through the gift of His Holy Spirit in our lives. 

Want to learn more about the gifts God gave through His Son Jesus Christ? Download Dr. McGee’s free digital booklet, [“Under the Tree: Eight Gifts Jesus Gives You at the Cross.”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_under-the-tree.pdf?sfvrsn=a0ab1e16_4)

**We’ve got more to celebrate. Tomorrow we’re off to Poland to praise God alongside a prisoner there.**
