If you caught the Bible Bus today, you already heard Gregg and Steve talk about the amazing things God is doing through His Word in India. ([Listen here](https://downloads.pod.co/35231dcc-3a21-4af5-bb67-36c5d48040bd/9e614d0e-6aca-407b-a079-32f86b80d310.mp3) if you have yet to hop aboard.) Let’s continue the celebration with this email from a listener of THRU the BIBLE in his language of Telugu.

*“I was invited to listen with a neighboring family a while ago, and God has spoken to me through each and every message. He has comforted our family in many different situations and life’s problems. We have come to know that we cannot hear such wonderful, loving words from any other, and we realized that no one can give such love to others except for the Lord. Together we decided to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior. We look forward to celebrating His birth this year and giving Him all the glory for the changes in our lives.”*

**We have more good news next week as our journey of praise continues. Until then, may God’s blessings be upon you.**
