 Taking Psalm 5:11 to heart


December 09, 2021

***But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You;******let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them; let those also who love Your name be joyful in You.***-Psalm5:11

*“My family was plagued by problems. We fought all the time and did not know how to move forward.”*

That’s what we recently heard from a listener who boards the Bible Bus in his language of Chhattisgarhi. Thankfully he found God’s Word on *Jindagi Ke Radda* (THRU the BIBLE), and his life began to change. Here’s the rest of his story.

*“From the moment I heard your teaching, I felt peace in my heart, and so I continued to listen daily. I started following the instructions, and God provided for my needs and all the questions in my life. Today I regularly listen to the programs and so does my family. We all are now in the faith. Our life isn’t perfect, but we choose to rejoice in the Lord and find joy with one another.”*

Today thank the Lord for the joy we, too, can find in Him. Pray all those on the Bible Bus are able to look past their circumstances this season and rejoice in the hope and peace God offers us through the gift of His Son, Jesus.

**Tomorrow we’re thanking God for changing the hearts of Muslims in Nigeria. Join us for the journey.**
