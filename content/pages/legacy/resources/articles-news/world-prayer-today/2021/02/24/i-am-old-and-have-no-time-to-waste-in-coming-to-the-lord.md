 “I am old and have no time to waste in coming to the Lord…”

Welcome to World Prayer Today. As we tour the sun-bleached ruins, piercing blue skies, and sample the flavorful cuisine, we also clearly see that God is at work in Greece. Share in the joy of this story from a listener named Mrs. Anthoula.

*“I am old and have no time to waste. After I heard your message on the radio, I called to receive a Bible. When it arrived, I couldn’t believe it was actually free. I feared it was a gimmick.* 

*“I spent some time reading and listening to more of your teachings. I had so many questions. So I called and asked your team. First on my mind was that I’ve lived 84 years, does God really want to forgive me when my best days are over? The person on the phone was gracious and helped me pray and accept Jesus as my Savior. I am so grateful for this new outlook on life. I pray God gives me many years to learn more about Him and serve Him as I’m able.”*

Whether we are 18 or 84, none of us has time to waste when we hear the truth about Jesus Christ. Keep traveling with us and asking God to change the hearts and lives of those who hear His Word.

**We’re praying Psalm 119:18 throughout Albania tomorrow. Glad to have you aboard.**
