 Exercising patience as we pray for Japan


August 23, 2021

***So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth;******it shall not return to Me void. But it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.*** *-*Isaiah 55:11

Today the World Prayer Team heads back to Japan, where we’re grateful God’s Word is going out, even though we receive little feedback from those who listen. 

Together let’s thank God for His promise in Isaiah 55:11 that His Word does not return void and ask Him to prosper His Word in the lives of the 120 million Japanese who have yet to hear the Good News. Let’s pray together now.

*Father, thank You for the opportunity we have to pray for the work You are already doing in the hearts of Japanese people through Your Word heard on THRU the BIBLE. Help it go far and wide today. Give us Your patience and the faith to know that when the time is right, we will see the results. It’s because of our love for You and Your Word that we are eager for every man, woman, and child to hear of Your saving grace and mercy to forgive us. Help them call on the precious name of Jesus and be saved. It’s in His name we pray, amen.* 

**Two-thirds of churches in Hong Kong are without a pastor. Join us as we pray tomorrow.**
