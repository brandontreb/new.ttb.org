 Pray for the starving in Myanmar


August 03, 2021

***Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.*** -Acts 3:19

If you follow the news, you’ve likely seen the devastating headlines about the hunger and humanitarian crisis in Myanmar following the political coup on February 1, 2021. 

More than 2.8 million were already food insecure, but now the UN World Food Program expects that number to jump to more than 3.5 million and continue to rise.

Today as we pray for the poor, the hungry, and the hopeless, let’s also thank God that His Word is bringing the Bread of Life to our fellow listeners like this one:

*“Through your programs in Burmese, I have heard about God’s love repeatedly. This topic never becomes monotonous. The more we hear, the more we benefit and develop spiritual strength. Now that we are back to working in the fields, we listen late at night and feel ourselves renewed after a long day. His presence takes us away from this world and we are refreshed. Please pray for us, that the weather will be good so we can work and feed our families.”*

God is working through His Word in Myanmar. Pray more will hear THRU the BIBLE and learn how they can have a personal, intimate relationship with the one and only God. 

Want to know how you can draw near to the Lord and be refreshed by His presence? Download Dr. McGee’s free booklet, [“How to Have Fellowship with God.”](/docs/default-source/booklets/ttb_how-to-have-fellowship-with-god.pdf?sfvrsn=c2c1f16_4)

**Pack your sense of adventure, tomorrow we’re headed to the mountains of Vietnam.**
