 What are you learning on the Bible Bus?


August 13, 2021

What are you learning on the Bible Bus? It’s a question we often ask, and the answers are always encouraging. Today a listener in the Democratic Republic of the Congo shares his terrific answer. We hope you’ll consider sharing yours today, too. 

*“Your teachings in Hebrews and Micah (and so many more) have given me strength and helped me to build my character. Many in the world today live as if each day is a chore or a checklist to be completed. The Bible gives us a way to live with purpose and joy. God’s Word can bring us beyond our burdens and help us live a life filled with blessing. I pray more people will listen to your programs and find this truth.”*   


Today, let’s echo that request and pray more people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo find their purpose for living for Jesus Christ.  

 And be sure encourage others with your story. [Tell us](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0d4f444f41484f585e4d59594f23627f6a) how God’s Word is changing and challenging you.  

**Next week we’re praying our way through southern Asia. Meet us on Monday in Assam, India.**
