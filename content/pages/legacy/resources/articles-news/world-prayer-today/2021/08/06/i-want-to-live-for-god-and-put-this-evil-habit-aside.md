 “I want to live for God and put this evil habit aside.”

***Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.*** -James 1:19-20  


Welcome to the Philippines. As we touch down today and explore this country made up of about 7,640 islands, we meet with a listener named Jerod who tells us how God’s Word heard on THRU the BIBLE has changed his life:

“*Please include me in your prayers. I want to change my life.* *I am having a hard time controlling my anger. I always get in trouble because of it and find it has no value. I have found your radio program and have been inspired to accept the Lord’s promises for my life. I want to live for God and put this evil habit aside.”*

What a great request. Today let’s thank God for the power of His Word to speak to our hearts about our sin, and pray for this listener and all of us who struggle with anger.  


*Heavenly Father, thank You for Your peace that passes our understanding. When anger rises from within us, calm our minds and soothe our hearts with Your Word. Help us to remember Your forgiveness in our lives and offer it to those who may be the subject of our frustrations. In all we do, may we reflect Your character, being slow to anger and rich in steadfast love. In the name of Jesus, amen.*

**We’re praying for atheists next time in Equatorial Guinea. We’ll meet you there.**
