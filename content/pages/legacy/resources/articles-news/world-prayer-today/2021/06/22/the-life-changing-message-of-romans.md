 The life changing message of Romans


June 22, 2021

*“*[Romans is] *the true masterpiece of the New Testament and the very purest gospel …. It can never be too much or too well read or studied. The more it is handled, the more precious it becomes, and the better it tastes.”* -Martin Luther

Have you spent much time in the book of Romans? Jack in the United Kingdom tells us how jumping on the Bible Bus for this study has changed His life.

*“I’ve been listening to your study in Romans and downloaded your booklet ‘One Hour in Romans.’ Never in such a short time have I learned so much. I thought I was a Christian, but never realized how much sin I had in my life. This teaching was both overwhelming and liberating. I can’t describe how much it has changed my thinking and my attitudes towards God. I am praying my friends and family will join me in these studies.”*

Today let’s pray for Jack’s family members and friends, as well as his countrymen in the UK. As they discover the joy of jumping into God’s Word with us, may they realize their sin and the important message of grace and salvation found in Jesus.

If you or someone you know wants to dig deeper into what Dr. McGee calls “one of the most important books of the Bible,” download his free booklet, [“One Hour in Romans”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_one-hour-in-romans.pdf?sfvrsn=99ef1e16_2) today. 

**God is at work in France. Meet us there tomorrow as we pray for THRU the BIBLE in French.**
