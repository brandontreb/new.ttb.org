 Praying for the next generation in Sweden


June 09, 2021

***These also who erred in spirit will come to understanding, and those who complained will learn doctrine.*** -Isaiah 29:24

It’s no secret, Sweden faces widespread spiritual decline. As the nation becomes increasingly liberal and secularized, the church has endorsed universalism and has questioned the divine authority of the Bible. The current generation is growing up believing that the church and God are not relevant to life, and it is pursuing materialism, hedonism, and individualism that matters most.

So today let’s pray for this generation and the next. Together, let’s ask God to use His Word heard on THRU the BIBLE to open their eyes to error and open their hearts to His truth. Through them, may Sweden return to its long and strong spiritual roots and once again be a beacon of light to northern Europe.

**We’re praying for the Sami people in Norway tomorrow. Come with praying hearts and hungry stomachs.**
