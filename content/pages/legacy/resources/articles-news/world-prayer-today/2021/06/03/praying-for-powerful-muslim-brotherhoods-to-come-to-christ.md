 Praying for powerful Muslim brotherhoods to come to Christ

***The earth is the******Lord******’s, and all its fullness, the world and those who dwell therein.*** -Psalm 24:1

Welcome, World Prayer Team. As our journey through western Africa continues this week, we stop in Senegal and pray for God’s Word to change the hearts and minds of the more than 96% of Senegalese who follow Islam.

While Senegal allows for religious freedom, very few of the Muslims there have ever come to Christ—perhaps because of the wealth and political power of organized Muslim brotherhoods. Some sources tell us more than 85% of Muslims belong to brotherhoods. 

Today, let’s praise God for His Word that reminds the Senegalese are His. Together let’s pray Psalm 24:1 over them.

*“Thank you, Lord for the promises found in your Word. Today we rejoice that the whole earth and everything in it belongs to You—including the more than 17,000,000 people who call Senegal their home. Today may each man, woman and child within its borders hear Your Word and understand the depth of Your love expressed through the sacrifice of Your Son, Jesus. It’s in His precious name we pray, amen.”*

**T****omorrow we’re in Niger, praying with a listener whose request is one many of us can identify with. Find out more on World Prayer Today.**
