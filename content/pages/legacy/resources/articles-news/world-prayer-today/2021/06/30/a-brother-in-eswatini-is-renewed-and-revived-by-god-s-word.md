 A brother in Eswatini is renewed and revived by God’s Word

***For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.*** -Philippians 1:21

The people of Eswatini are no strangers to pandemics. HIV infection in this small country is estimated to affect about 27% of the population.

However, this year the concern on many minds has shifted from HIV to Covid-19 because the country’s death rate (3.9%) is more than twice that of the US and higher than its largest neighbor, South Africa.

Today as we pray for those hurting from the loss of family members and friends, let’s also thank God for the hope and healing His Word has brought to listeners like this one:

*“**Last year was very tough. We lost members of our family through COVID-19. I am a regular listener of* Thru the Bible *in my language of Zulu and thank God for the encouragement He’s given me through His Word.* 

*“I was down and disturbed, but growing closer to God I feel renewed and revived. Thank you for turning my heart to Philippians 1:21 and reminding us that to live is Christ (He is my source of joy, my reason to live) and to die is gain (I will be with Him in eternity). We will continue worshiping God and listening to this program. Thank you from a humble servant.”*

What an amazing story. Today as you come before God, remember Philippians 1:21 and thank Him for this promise in the lives of brothers and sisters in Eswatini—and in your life, too. 

**There’s a lot to pray about tomorrow in South Africa. Meet us there.**
