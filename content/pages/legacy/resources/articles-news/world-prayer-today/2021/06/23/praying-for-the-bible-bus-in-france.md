 Praying for the Bible Bus in France


June 23, 2021

***“Come to******Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.******Take My yoke upon you******and learn from Me, for I am******gentle and******lowly in heart,******and you will find rest for your souls.******For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”*** **-**Matthew 11:28-30

Our travels through western Europe continue today as we journey through the most visited tourist destination in the world: France. In our tour of some of the most beautiful cathedrals throughout the country, we quickly realize that France’s spiritual heritage is a thing of the past. 

Today the Bible is alien to most French people—less than 10% own one and 80% have never even handled one. Yet experts tell us Bible sales are at an all-time high, spurred by the spiritual hunger evident among many and the availability of inexpensive ($2 each!) Bibles in supermarkets and secular bookstores. 

Today let’s thank God for those who are seeking Him—like Sylvie, a new passenger on the Bible Bus.

*“I did not know such programs existed in French, and I would like to have the entire series. I have many problems, and I believe the Bible may have the answers. Please pray I find relief.”*

As we lift up Sylvie today, pray also for the millions of French who are carrying life’s burdens on their own. May God’s Word heard on THRU the BIBLE reach them with the good news that Jesus is ready and willing to give them rest—in fact, He’s the only one who can.

Is your life hard right now? God’s Word can help. Download Dr. McGee’s free booklet, [“What to Do When Life is Hard”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_what-to-do-when-life-is-hard.pdf?sfvrsn=fe501e16_2) today. 

**A listener in the Netherlands requests our prayers. Join us tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
