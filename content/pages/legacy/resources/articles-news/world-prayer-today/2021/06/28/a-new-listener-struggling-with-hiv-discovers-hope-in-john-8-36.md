 A new listener struggling with HIV discovers hope in John 8:36

**“Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be** **free indeed.”** -John 8:36

How are you feeling today? Has worry or fear over your circumstances got you down? If so, you aren’t alone. Listen to this story from a new THRU the BIBLE listener in South Africa.

*“I am one of many in my country infected with HIV. In recent years, I have begun to feel imprisoned and controlled by my disease. This has brought me great depression, and I have begun to spend my days in worry. A friend recently told me about your Bible study, and I now spend a good portion of my day renewing my mind with God’s truth instead of focusing on my problems. Thanks to you, I have John* *8:36 in my heart and am living with hope and freedom. Thank you for the wonderful program.”*

What a great reminder of the power we have in Jesus. Today pray more people in South Africa**—**and all over the world**—**hear His Word and are reminded that His freedom, strength, hope, and joy are available to us when we call upon His name. 

**Your prayers are needed for young people in Botswana. Join us for the journey.**
