 Why do you love the Bible?

***So you may walk in the way of goodness, and keep to the paths of righteousness*****.** -Proverbs 2:20 

 Complex, diverse, and compelling. That’s how many describe the country of Vietnam.  

 Welcome, prayer travelers. As we make our way through streets of Hanoi lined with motorbikes and hike the evergreen hills around Bac Ha, we stop in between and meet with Dahn, a fellow listener who has traveled quite a distance to meet with us and tell us why he loves God’s Word.  

 *“I live in a rural area where there is no church. A pastor visits regularly, but because of Covid-19 we have not seen him much. Your program keeps me growing in the Lord. I have learned many things as I listen.*

*“During this time, people in my village have* *abandoned their former way of life and participate in evil practices, such as drinking to get drunk, burning charms, and worshipping ancestors. But God’s Word helps me walk in the path of righteousness. As I study the Bible, day by day my faith is strengthened and my heart is softened. Like it says in Proverbs 2:20, I pray to walk in the way of goodness.”*  

 Praise God for Dhan and for others who are faithful to the Lord in Vietnam. Pray more people in remote areas of Southeastern Asia will hear His Word and walk away from their evil practices and turn to the paths of righteousness.

We loved hearing why Dahn loves the Bible. Would you tell us why you love it, too? Does it comfort you? Challenge you? Change you? We’d love to know. Just grab your mobile phone or computer and make a 30-second video and tell us why you love the Bible. Then visit [TTB.org/love](https://www.ttb.org/love) and upload it. Again, just answer, “I love the Bible because …” and upload it today.  


**A suicidal wife and mother in Thailand hears God’s Word for the first time. Join us tomorrow for her remarkable story.**
