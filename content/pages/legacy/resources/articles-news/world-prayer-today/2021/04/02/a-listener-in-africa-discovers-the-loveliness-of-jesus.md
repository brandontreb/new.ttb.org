 A listener in Africa discovers the loveliness of Jesus

***Yes, he is altogether lovely.******This is my beloved, and this is my friend ….***-Song of Solomon 5:16

*“I am so glad to belong to Jesus. Before I encountered His loveliness, I was living in hopelessness.”*

That’s the beginning of an amazing story of God’s grace in the life of Benji who listens to THRU the BIBLE in his language of Fongbe. Here’s the rest of his story.

*“I always doubted my future. Added to all that, I was full of envy and jealousy. Bitterness was my daily bread. I knew I was a bad person, but your program introduced me to the gospel of grace demonstrated through the death of Jesus on the cross. I believed immediately and I started to gather with some other beloved brothers and sisters at a nearby church. As they modeled the fruit of the Holy Spirit, I asked God to work in my life too. I soon began to change. I also started to pray, and I began listening to your programs daily.* 

*“Step by step, I noticed that my jealousy, envy, and hatred began to disappear. I experienced the love of God through the love of brothers and sisters who encouraged me, loved me, and did not judge me. Today, I am sharing your programs by speaker with my neighbors. Many people come to my shop to sit and listen. They do not know me, but they become my friends after listening to the Word of God and keep coming to hear more about Him.”*

Praise God for the power of His Word. On this Good Friday, take some time to soak up His loveliness and grace in your life, too. As you experience His beauty, may the significance of His death and resurrection transform you again and again.

**There is more to pray about and celebrate next week as we travel through Oceania. We’ll meet you there.**
