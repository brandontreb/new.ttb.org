 Pray for God’s Word to satisfy in Taiwan

***Blessed are those who******hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.***-Matthew 5:6 

 Very few Christians live in Taiwan, and the need for pastors and Bible teachers is huge.

Welcome, World Prayer Team. As we travel through the thriving metropolis of Taipei, we stop and visit with a listener who tells us more.

*“My spiritual background is traditional for Chinese people, but I have found your programs and have come to know the Lord. I crave His Word, and your teaching is the only thing that satisfies my soul. It can be hard to find here, so* Thru the Bible *is special. I have missed many programs before now, is there a way I can find them?”*

Praise God for the growing appetite He gives us as we study His Word. Pray more in Taiwan and around the world will realize that true satisfaction and fulfillment is found only in a relationship with God and in a daily diet of studying His Word. As more in Taiwan turn to Him, pray those who God is calling to teach and pastor will respond to His prompting and are equipped to lead His church.

**It’s a privilege to pray alongside you. Join us tomorrow as we pray for hurting families in China.**
