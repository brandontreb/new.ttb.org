 “I never miss a radio program”


August 31, 2018
![]()




Today our world prayer journey brings us to the state of Maharashtra, India, where we meet with a listener of our Deccani language broadcasts. 


He writes:


*“One day I was very upset and depressed so I turned on my radio in order that some music might cheer my spirits. Instead, I heard a message from you on peace—John 14:27. This was no coincidence. It was as if God Himself was speaking to me. At the end of the program, I prayed with the teacher and I felt a unique peace come over me … it was like nothing I had ever experienced before.* 


*“I now know the saving grace of the Lord and never miss a radio program, as it helps me walk according to His Word. Thank you for sharing this life-changing message with me.”*


What an encouraging report! Let’s keep praying that more listeners of our Deccani broadcast hear God’s Word and respond in faith! 


**Thank you for your partnership in prayer. Join us next week as the World Prayer Team travels to Southeast Asia.**
