 New life from tragedy


December 18, 2018

How did you come to the Lord? Everyone’s testimony is a miracle, and it never grows old to hear about how God gets our attention and meets our spiritual need. 


Bablu from Madhya Pradesh in the heart of India shares how God met him in his fear: 


*“I am from the Gond tribe and I was a devout worshipper of many gods and goddesses. One day, while returning home from work, I witnessed a horrible motorcycle accident—the victim’s head was severed from his body. For days this image kept playing in my mind. I became so afraid that I fell sick. My wife took me to a doctor. He assured me that nothing was wrong with me and he gave me medicine to bring down my fever. However, no medicines brought me peace. I was haunted by the accident. I lived in constant fear.* 


*“One day my wife purchased a radio for me to occupy my mind. That night, I tuned the radio to listen to music to help me sleep peacefully. I heard a voice speaking the Gondi language—my mother tongue! Surprised and very excited, I started listening to the program (Thru the Bible). The message was on ‘Do not fear, I am with you.’*


*“Wow—it was a word in due season for me; hearing it brought peace and something wonderful happened in my heart. On returning home from work the following day, I could not wait for the program. I kept looking at the clock. When the time came, my wife and I tuned in and listened to your program. The message was: ‘Jesus is the Way, Truth, and Life’ and my heart opened. I realized that I am a sinner and I need Jesus to save me and deliver me. I was amazed that Jesus died for my sins; I cried to the Lord, repented for my sins, and invited Jesus into my life. Actually, it was a day of double rejoicing and celebrations—my wife also committed her life to Jesus. This journey of faith started two years ago and we are experiencing the blessings of the Lord in our lives.”* 


Praise God today for how He uses every circumstance in our lives to draw us to Himself. Consider the events of your life and how God uses them to welcome you to a closer relationship with Him. 


Thank you for praying this year for people like Bablu. God is hearing and answering our intercession. 


**Join us tomorrow as the celebration of new life in Christ continues on World Prayer Today.**
