 Sound the trumpet!


February 06, 2018
![]()




*“Thanks for loudly sounding the trumpet!”*


That’s what a faithful man of God in Ethiopia wrote us. His letter is a great reminder that the Word of God will not return void—it will always accomplish God’s purpose. In this case, *Thru the Bible* is being used by God to train up a pastor of a local church. Here’s his story: 


*“Thanks for the powerful and wonderful spiritual help you are making available through your TTB radio program. I have been an enthusiastic listener for many years. I always look forward to the next day’s program. Your Bible teaching has laid a good foundation of the Word of God in my life. I am now a minister of the gospel of Christ—thanks to your model and faithfulness. Thanks for all the timely messages and for loudly sounding the trumpet. I’ll keep proclaiming the good news here and may God continue to bless His Word in the lives of my people here and also around the world.”*


**Your prayers play a strategic part in God’s Word getting to people like this pastor. Keep it up … and keep sounding the trumpet in your community! Invite others to pray with us at** **[**TTB.org/pray**](http://www.TTB.org/pray)****.**
