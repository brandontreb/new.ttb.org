 God must love it!

What does God love? 


A new brother in India, Mr. Anett, sends us great encouragement from Scripture. He writes: 


*“The work of the radio is a great possibility for the preaching of the gospel. I believe God must love it because He tells us through the prophet Isaiah that ‘how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that brings good news.’ But where good news goes, so do spiritual attacks. Sometimes they can be very hard, but God is wise. Believe and you will see God’s miracles. Just think—this spiritual war is between evil and God. And everything is God’s own—including His victory. Let us be awesome instruments at the work of prayer! Let us persevere because He who began a good work in us will finish it. I know that you are important soldiers of God. Keep praying.”*


Did you hear that encouragement, prayer warrior? Let us not grow weary, but keep praying! 


**Tomorrow we’ll hear more about God’s work in surprising places . . .**
