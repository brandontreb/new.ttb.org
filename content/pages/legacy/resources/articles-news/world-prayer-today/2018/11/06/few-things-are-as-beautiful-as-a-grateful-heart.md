 Few things are as beautiful as a grateful heart

Few things are as beautiful as a grateful heart. 


Maria wrote this email to us from Paraguay:


*“Thank you for the beautiful studies that you have given us. My prayer is that our God will bless you richly for making this possible in our country in our language of Guarani. I love studying the Bible because we always have a new thing to learn while we are reading it, and this knowledge never ends. Hugs from this listener that is waiting for the next study with much joy.”* 


Let’s together praise God with Maria for solid Bible teaching that is available in Paraguay through the faithful prayer and financial support of *Thru the Bible*. (Did you feel her hug?!) May you share the joy that she shares for studying God’s Word. 


**Tomorrow we travel on our knees to the Latin American country of Honduras.**
