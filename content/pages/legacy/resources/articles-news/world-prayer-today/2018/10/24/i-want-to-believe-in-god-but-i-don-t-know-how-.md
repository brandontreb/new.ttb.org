 “I want to believe in God, but I don’t know how.”


October 24, 2018
![]()




Welcome to the Philippines where God’s Word is taught on *Thru the Bible* in three languages: Ilocano, Tagalog, and Cebuano. 


As we stop and pray today, remember the producers of each of these language broadcasts and those who work with them to answer the many daily texts, emails, phone calls, and letters they receive each day.


To give you an idea of the important follow-up work they are engaged in, here is a peek at just a few of the requests they’ve received.


A young woman named Angela texts: *“Good evening pastor! I’ve been listening to your program. I just want to know how I can believe in God. Honestly, I am wondering how to start. I really wanted to, but I don’t know how.”*


A gentleman named Rogers emails: *“Hi Brother! I’m a soldier assigned here in Mindanao. I’ve been monitoring your program. I found it so helpful for my spiritual life. As a soldier, I cannot make it to church, but through your radio program I am able to grow spiritually. I am lonely; please write back.”*


Another woman named Evelyn emails: *“It’s a blessing to be in God’s presence through His words. Thank you so much for sharing the Word of God. May the Lord bless you more and more! Can you please recommend a local church that teaches the Word as you do?”*


Aren’t these wonderful inquiries? As you go about your day, ask God to multiply the fruit of those who respond. Pray that God will give them strength, humility, and graciousness as they minister in His name today.
