 Praying for the 600,000+ Muslims living in Australia


March 29, 2022
![]()




Our prayer journey through Oceania continues today as we spend time in Sydney and Melbourne, the two cities in Australia with the highest percentage of Muslim residents.

Reports estimate more than 600,000 Muslims live in Australia, with most of them staying within their own social and cultural communities.

Please join us in praying for *THRU the BIBLE’s Arabic* and Hindi programs to be effective within these communities. Pray God’s love and message of peace cause them to question what they’ve been taught about Islam and draw them into an eternal relationship with our Lord Jesus (see John 3:16).

**You won’t want to miss tomorrow’s prayer stop in Fiji. See you there.**

Listen here to [TTB-Arabic](https://ttb.twr.org/home/day,0431/language,ARB) and [TTB-Hindi.](https://ttb.twr.org/home/day,0432/language,HIN)
