 Why is it important to study the Bible?

*“To stand in days like these, you need to be rooted in the Word of God.”* –Dr. J. Vernon McGee

*“God’s Word keeps me on the right path. There are many horrible things happening in this world, but we must still maintain the holiness of our lives by living according to His Word and allowing the Lord Jesus to purify our hearts. I will pray this for you; please pray this for me, as well. None of us are beyond the ability to veer in the wrong direction.”*

That’s the good word we hear from Duma, a fellow Bible Bus passenger in East Java, Indonesia. When we’re on our knees today, let’s echo her prayer for those who watch THRU the BIBLE on Indonesian satellite TV and ask God to use His Word to protect our hearts and minds as well. 

Want to learn more? Download Dr. McGee’s free digital booklet, [“Living for God in a World that Has Forgotten Him.”](/docs/default-source/booklets/ttb_living-for-god-in-a-world-that-has-forgotten-him.pdf?sfvrsn=352c1816_2) 

**We’re traveling to India and Pakistan tomorrow. Grab your passport and be ready to go!**
