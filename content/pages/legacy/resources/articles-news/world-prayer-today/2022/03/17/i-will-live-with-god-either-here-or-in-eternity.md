 “I will live with God … either here or in eternity”


March 17, 2022

Urdu is the official language of Pakistan and also widely spoken throughout India and Bangladesh. That’s why THRU the BIBLE is committed to expanding our ministry in Urdu, including the addition of a satellite TV program. Please pray more listeners like these hear God’s Word and respond:

A father in India writes: *“We are the only Christian family we know of. There is no church near us, and there are no pastors to visit. The twelve of us gather regularly for your teaching and are blessed by knowing God.”*

A man in Pakistan tells us: *“One evening as I was preparing for bed, my phone rang from an international number I did not recognize. Curious, I answered and heard the voice of a distant relative in Saudi Arabia. He heard of my recent illness and wanted to pray for me. After that He told me about your programs that would offer me peace and comfort throughout my treatment. Now I have learned to give my problems and my life to Jesus. I am grateful for this relief in my life and trust that no matter the outcome, I will live with God … either here on earth or in eternity.”*

**There is no denying it, God is at work and answering our prayers. Meet us here tomorrow as Gregg Harris tells us about more great things happening because God’s Word is being taught.**
