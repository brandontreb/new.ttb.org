 “If God made the world and He made me, I must have a place here.”

***“Assuredly, I say to you,******inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.”*** -Matthew 25:40 

 Nomads, itinerants, wanderers—however you choose to describe the mobile Roma people, throughout history they’ve been called much worse. Living scattered all over Europe for centuries, they have experienced slavery, oppression, prejudice, and are often looked down upon by society.  

 Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today we’re in Albania rejoicing with Ilda who recently heard God’s Word on THRU the BIBLE and was surprised to find that God values her so much He sent His own Son to die on her behalf. Here’s her story:

 *“I am a 19-year-old Roma girl. I grew up in a very poor family. We were often spit upon and called names. Finding work for my parents was difficult. In our community, the girls marry very young. I was only 15 years old.* 

 *“I have had many difficulties in my life but have recently heard your program and feel a burden being lifted. I was surprised to hear that Jesus accepts even the Roma. That in His kingdom, we are all equal. That He died not just for those who are rich, but also for me. The truth is He is more like than me than He was like them. This simple fact is changing the way I see myself and the way I see the world. If God made the world and He made me, I must have a place here. I must have a purpose. Now my mother, my mother-in-law, and I listen every day. We are eager to walk in God’s promises. Thank you for this teaching.”* 

 Pray more Roma people across Southern Europe (and beyond) hear God’s Word taught on THRU the BIBLE. Like Ilda, may they come to realize that God cares deeply for the persecuted and oppressed. As you do, ask Him to keep our hearts sensitive and compassionate toward those who are undervalued by the world’s standards. 

**Your prayers for secret believers in Eastern Africa are needed. Meet us in Somalia tomorrow.**
