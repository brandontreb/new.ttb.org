 A herdsman in Eastern Asia is praying for you

***Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.*** -1 Thessalonians 5:16-18

As we travel the world together, praying for God’s whole Word to reach the whole world, did you know there are others praying for you? Be encouraged today by Myagmar in Mongolia.

 *“I am a herdsman. I have been married for 15 years, and together we have eight children. I listen to* Thru the Bible *while tending to livestock in the pasture. Then throughout the week I try to implement something I have been studying. Due to the biblical lessons, I have been learning about humble character and Christian people’s wrong attitudes. Most importantly I learned what it means to pray constantly. Now while I work, I not only listen but pray and commune with God. Among the things I thank Him for are your teaching, for those who study with us, and for everything we are learning. May we all continue to give Him thanks and rejoice in gifts He gives us each day.”* 

 Today (and every day) let’s join Myagmar in thanking God for His Word and for those who study it with us. As we do, let’s continue to pray people in Eastern Asia find satisfaction in God when they discover the disciplines described in Thessalonians 5:16-18. 

 **Northern Africa isn’t exactly fertile ground for the gospel. Pray with us tomorrow.**
