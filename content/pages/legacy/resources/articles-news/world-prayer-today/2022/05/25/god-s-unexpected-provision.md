 God’s unexpected provision


May 25, 2022

“Make the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil” (see Ephesians 5:16).

An unexpected ministry offers unexpected opportunities to see how God provides. That’s the story we hear from Kontráné in Hungary. He says:

*“I have some family and friends who were interested in THRU the BIBLE but couldn’t find a way to listen. So I began streaming over the phone. I was thrilled as the group expanded, but then I received last month's phone bill. I didn't want to believe my eyes, it was enormous. Instead of trusting God, I became nervous and sick to my stomach. My stomach nervousness immediately came into play, which came out as usual in special situations. Almost immediately the words of Ephesians 5:16 came to mind. Ground help also arrived immediately from my brother, who took over half of the amount. My stomach cramps were immediately replaced by the joy that God is using me to help build His kingdom.”*

Thank God for this gentleman and all those who see a way to share God’s Word and jump at the chance to do so. Today pray more of us will join Him in making the most of every opportunity—however God is calling us. May we, too, be reminded that when He is with us, He will provide. 

**A listener asks us to pray for her prison ministry. Join us tomorrow in the Czech Republic.**
