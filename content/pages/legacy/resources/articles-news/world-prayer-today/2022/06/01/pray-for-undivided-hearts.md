 Pray for undivided hearts


June 01, 2022

***“******Then I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them, and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God.”*** -Ezekiel 11:19-20

No matter where we call home, living for God isn’t easy. A listener in Burkina Faso tells us that’s why he’s especially grateful to join us on the Bible Bus each day. Here’s his story:

*“We live in a fragile society. People are unhappy, depressed, full of despair and aggressive. We don't know any more how to say, ‘hello, thank you, sorry, please.’ Everyone is on their phone and we no longer look or even take an interest in the person who lives next to us. Thank you again, this message draws our attention to the essential virtues that we are already losing. I will be praying that more people find you and therefore find God.”*

That’s a great prayer. Let’s pray along with him and use Ezekiel 11:19-20 as our guide.

*Father, we celebrate Your Word that is changing lives in Burkina Faso. Let all those who hear it have an undivided heart for You. Fill them with a new Spirit that alone can turn stone hearts to flesh. Help us all to press on to know You fully and trust You with our lives.* 

*As they are transformed from the old heart and spirit to the new, give them the joy that comes from following You and Your Word out of love. Make them become Your people and create in them the desire to call You their God. In the name of Jesus, through whom all this is possible, amen.* 

**God’s Word is finding a foothold in the Muslim-dominant country of Senegal. Celebrate with us tomorrow.**
