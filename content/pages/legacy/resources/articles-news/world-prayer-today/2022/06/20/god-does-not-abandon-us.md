 God does not abandon us

*“I want to know more about God’s forgiveness. I heard a program of yours and you mentioned that God allows us to repent.”*

That’s what we hear from Anna as we travel through Austria today. She continues: 

*“Please help me understand. I have done many bad things in my life and my family has not forgiven me or allowed me to forget. Will God still accept me? I am confused, but desperately need peace in my heart.”*

Praise God, He doesn’t abandon us to our mistakes. Pray for Anna and all those who are ready to accept God’s gift of salvation and receive His forgiveness from their sins. Ask Him to give them the strength to live a life that’s pleasing to Him. 

Learn more about God’s forgiveness and how you can leave your sins behind you in Dr. McGee’s free digital booklet, [“Forget About It: How to Put the Past Behind You.”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_forget-about-it.pdf?sfvrsn=d91a1e16_2)

**We’ve got a bold prayer for the U.K. Join us tomorrow.**
