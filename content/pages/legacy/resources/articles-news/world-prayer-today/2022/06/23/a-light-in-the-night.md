 A light in the night


June 23, 2022

***Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.”*** -John 8:12

*“Your program is a light in the night. I listen on my break during my graveyard shifts. You have explained the Bible in ways I have never heard before. God is good providing this teaching through you.”*

Yes! God’s Word is a light in the darkness in so many ways. As you thank Him for that today, continue to pray for several home groups in the Netherlands that hear THRU the BIBLE in Dutch on USB sticks. Ask God to grow their numbers and their excitement about sharing His Word within their communities.

**Don’t waste the opportunities God gives you. That’s the lesson we’ll hear on the Bible Bus tomorrow and also from a listener on World Prayer Today.**
