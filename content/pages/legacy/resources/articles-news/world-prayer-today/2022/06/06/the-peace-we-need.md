 The peace we need


June 06, 2022

***Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord******Jesus Christ******.*** -Romans 5:1

Finland is draped with lush forests and dotted with thousands of lakes. It’s no surprise then the Finnish people value the peace they often find in the quiet of nature and solitude. 

Today as we pray for THRU the BIBLE going out in Finnish, let’s ask that many find the true and lasting peace only possible in Jesus.

*Father, thank You for Jesus, our mighty Lord and Prince of Peace. Thank You for sending Him to give us Your peace. It’s nothing like the world gives. It is peace born in the freedom we have in You, a gift to all Your children—to guard our hearts and minds. We pray many in Finland will discover this gift and place their trust in You. Despite their circumstances, despite their challenges, help them realize that You have overcome the world and Your peace is beyond all we can understand or desire. In the name of Jesus we pray, amen.*

**Our prayer journey takes us to Norway tomorrow—see you there.**
