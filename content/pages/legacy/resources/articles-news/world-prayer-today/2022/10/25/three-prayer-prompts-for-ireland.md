 Three prayer prompts for Ireland


October 25, 2022
![]()




What country has more than 30,000 castles, uses two different currencies, and has the highest population of natural redheads? 

As you’ve probably guessed, our journey today brings us to Ireland where we’re interceding for God’s Word heard by app in English, Luganda, Arabic, and more.

In 2019 an estimated 622,700 non-Irish nationals were living in Ireland, making up 12.7% of the total population. Today as we gather on our knees, let’s intercede for them as well as the spiritual decline throughout the entire country. Here are a few prompts to get us started:

1. Pray for the spiritually curious. Pray those who seek God find THRU the BIBLE in their heart language. May God’s Word provide both comfort and conviction to all who hear it.
2. Pray for the culturally diverse. Ask God to give Irish believers a heart for the immigrants among them.
3. Pray for spiritual renewal in Ireland’s churches. As we’ve learned on previous travels, regular church attendance has dropped from 85% to below 50%, and an increasing number of Irish are non-religious. As church doors open each day, pray more people fill the pews and re-discover the joy of fellowshipping with each other and worshiping God.

Through the Holy Spirit we know anything is possible. So together let’s pray and watch God move in Ireland.

**Our worldwide prayer trek continues tomorrow in Switzerland. Pack your bags and meet us there.**
