 Sound the alarm


October 07, 2022
![]()




***And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.*** -Romans 13:11-12

*“My heart is filled with joy to know that, thanks to this beautiful ministry, many are transferred from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light.”*

That’s the encouragement we receive from a fellow Bible Bus passenger in Belize. He continues:  
  
*“May God continue to use you as the alarm clock of the Most High in these difficult times. May many be awakened by His Word and may you be rewarded for your work. I pray His grace is manifested in all those who study with us.”*

Today pray Romans 13:11-12 as God’s Word goes out in Belize and around the world:

*Thank You, Father, that the call of Jesus to meet Him in the clouds is getting closer with each passing day. Awaken all those who hear Your Word today, spur us to walk away from darkness and use the time before Jesus returns for us for Your glory. In His name, amen.*

 **Good things are ahead for our team next week. Join us here for the journey.**
