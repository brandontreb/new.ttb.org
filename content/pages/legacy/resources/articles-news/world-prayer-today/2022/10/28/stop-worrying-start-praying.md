 Stop worrying, start praying

***Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms.*** -James 5:13

*“Stop worrying, start praying.”*

That’s advice a listener named Sara in Germany received from her mother-in-law. Here’s the rest of the story.

*“In my thirties I began to develop a lot of fears. I was beginning to lose any joy I had in my life. My mother-in-law pulled me aside one day and said I needed to listen to your programs and learn to trust God. She said I needed to stop worrying and start praying. While I didn’t think it would make much difference, I did listen to her advice. As I began to understand the heart of God and His plans for my life, I began praying frequently. Soon I began to feel lighter and more content. Now I listen every day and try to focus on the things in my life I can control and the things I am grateful for.”*

What a great reminder. Today, thank God that His plan and purpose for our lives is far beyond anything we can imagine for ourselves. Ask Him to help us trust Him with our fears and encourage our family members and friends to do the same. 

Need help?Download Dr. McGee’s free digital booklet,[“How to Have Peace in Anxious Times.”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/ttb_how-to-have-peace-in-anxious-times.pdf?sfvrsn=ff351e16_2) And as God’s Word goes out in Germany, pray more listeners like Sara give Him theirworries and doubts.

**God is at work in unlikely places. Join us next week as we praise Him and pray for His intervention in the Middle East.**
