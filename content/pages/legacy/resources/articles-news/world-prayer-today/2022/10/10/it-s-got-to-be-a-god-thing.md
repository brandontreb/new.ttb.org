 It’s got to be a “God thing”


October 10, 2022

Welcome, World Prayer Team. This week we have the privilege of praying for THRU the BIBLE’s Home Groups (more than 20,000 documented small group gatherings and many more only God knows about) that meet in homes throughout India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
 Nepal, and Sri Lanka. 

If you’ve been on the World Prayer Team for long, you’ve been praying for this list to grow … and God is answering!

Soon you’ll hear about new groups starting in Ghana, Togo, Kenya, Tanzania, and also in Suriname. Europe and the Arab world are not far behind.

The growth in this movement can only be what we call a “God-thing.” We never could have imagined this simple concept of studying God’s Word in neighborhood and small group settings would be so successful—especially in places where
 you’d be hard-pressed to find the formal teaching of God’s Word anywhere. And yet, it makes perfect sense! 

Neighborhoods in India and through south Asia are not like what many westerners are used to. People live in close proximity to one another, and often without air conditioning. Windows are open, and multiple generations fill their homes. When they want
 to share something with their neighbors, they turn up the volume so the neighbors can listen whether they want to or not. And praise the Lord more and more want to!

This week as we meet some of these fellow listeners and lift up these groups—those that are established, those in infancy, and those yet to be formed—here are a few specific ways you can pray: 

1. Praise God that His Word clearly is having impact in areas where the name of Jesus is being heard for the first time. Pray the Bible Bus travels to new places without hindrance. Pray with joy and confidence in God!
2. Pray for the safety of groups meeting in countries where the Bible is prohibited. Because the gatherings are in homes and not in public places, the risk is lower—but still present.
3. Intercede for new THRU the BIBLE groups beginning in Bosnia, Turkey, and Macedonia as they face the unique challenges of ministry in eastern Europe.
4. Pray for God to do “His thing” in your life, too. Ask Him to bring to mind those you could invite into your home to fellowship and listen to THRU the BIBLE.

**Tomorrow meet a home group listener in a very unlikely place—Afghanistan!**
