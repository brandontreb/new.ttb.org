 Faithfully following God in Afghanistan


October 11, 2022
![]()




In Afghanistan, if a Christian*’*s new faith is discovered, their family, clan, or tribe saves its honor by disowning the believer, or even killing him or her. So, it’s no surprise the majority of phone calls and emails THRU the BIBLE’s team receives are aggressive and sometimes even threatening. 

Yet, in the midst of  anger and fear, a few people like Alaem (not his real name) are quietly coming to faith. Here’s his story:

*“Through your programs, I heard the gospel and found Jesus Christ, my Savior. In the event that you had not shared about Him, I would be blind and hard of hearing like the Bible says. Thank you for taking the risk. I have discreetly talked with two trusted companions about Jesus, and they too have acknowledged Him. I will continue to listen and serve God as best as I can.”*

Since there are no churches or Christian bookstores in Afghanistan, access to God’s Word is extremely limited, and meeting with other Christians is dangerous. As THRU the BIBLE goes out in the language of Pashto, ask God to multiply the number of His people and to encourage and instruct the few like Alaem who are already faithfully following Him despite the risks. 

**A listener in India finds a faith that “sticks.” Find out what that means tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
