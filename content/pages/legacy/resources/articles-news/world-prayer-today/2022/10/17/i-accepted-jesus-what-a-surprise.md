 “I accepted Jesus … what a surprise”


October 17, 2022

Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today as we travel through the province of Quebec, we thank God for His Word that is changing lives.

*Joseph tells us:* *“I had the privilege of listening to the*Thru the Bible*program and it changed my life. I now tell everyone I know about it. I was opposed to rituals, but you made the distinction Christianity is a relationship. That made a huge difference. Thanks for everything.”*  

Annabelle shared: *“I was lonely and depressed. I heard your program one evening and decided to call you. By the end of the conversation, I accepted Jesus. What a surprise. Thank you for caring for me and thank You to God for saving me.”*

*Aren’t these terrific stories? Today pray more French speaking people in Canada hear God’s Word on THRU the BIBLE. Ask Him to use it to change the minds of many like Joseph who look unfavorably on Christianity. May God’s life-saving message of grace soon be praised throughout all of Canada.*

***We’re praying for prodigals tomorrow in Boulder, Colorado. Join us in bringing them before the Lord.***
