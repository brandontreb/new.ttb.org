 Urgent: Your prayers are needed in China

***And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands for us; yes, establish the work of our hands******.*** -Psalm 90:17

Sharing God’s Word in China is getting harder each day. Ministry partners tell us these are some of the darkest days in decades in terms of freedom of religious expression. Yet we know even now God’s favor is with us, establishing the work of our hands. 

Please pray for THRU the BIBLE, our partners, and all those working on behalf of the name of Jesus Christ. Whatever plans the enemy has to halt communication and keep God’s Word from reaching those who need it, let those strategies be thwarted, resulting in more victories like this one:

*“In your study of Genesis, God showed me how much I am like Jacob. He began to deal with my* *deceitfulness, selfishness, pride, hypocrisy, etc. and taught me faithfulness, compassion, humility, and sincerity. I am thankful for teachings of truth and prompting of the Holy Spirit. I will constantly renew and change myself all my life. I still possess some bad qualities that God dislikes and am needing Him to change me over and over. May God grant me power to overcome fleshly desires so I can live a victorious life.”*

**We’ll meet you tomorrow in Mongolia, where a listener tells us, “I want to know more about Jesus Christ and the Word of the Bible.”**
