 It’s time to get excited about God’s Word

***But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You; let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them; let those also who love Your name******be joyful in You.*** -Psalm 5:11

As we study God’s Word together, we’re learning there is a time to bow and worship God, a time to sing and praise Him, and a time to shout in excitement and praise to Him. 

Welcome to Brazil where today we meet with Iolanda who shares her enthusiasm for all she’s learning on the Bible Bus.

*“God’s Word is energizing.* *I'd like to spend all day listening, but I have my work to do. Whenever I hear you teach, God’s Word moves me and my heart races so much. I often sing and shout ‘Hallelujah’ when you read from Scripture directly. I hope others are, too. All that we learn is exciting, and I cherish each study. Please pray for me, because I want to be holy because God is holy.”* 

Isn’t her enthusiasm wonderful? Today pray God’s Word energizes all those who study with us. May God’s joy be ours and our love for Him be obvious to those we meet.

**A father and mother in Uruguay leave a huge inheritance to their children. Hear this great story tomorrow as we travel together on our knees.**
