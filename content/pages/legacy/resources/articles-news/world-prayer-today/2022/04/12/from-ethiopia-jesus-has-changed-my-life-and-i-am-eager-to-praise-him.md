 From Ethiopia: “Jesus has changed my life and I am eager to praise Him.”

***Oh, that men would give thanks to the******Lord******for His goodness,******and for His wonderful works to the children of men! For He satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with goodness.*** -Psalm 107:8-9

Our journey of praise continues as we give thanks for this listener who joins us on the Bible Bus in Ethiopia:

*“My family and I did not belong to any religion. My father used to exercise witchcraft. One day we heard a strange voice that came from the middle of our village. I ran to the place and saw people gathered, singing and praying. They said they were Christian and gave us radios to listen to your program. They said that God will fill any longings and desires we have.*  
  
*“It took me many days to process and understand what you were saying, but not long after I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and my Savior. Since then, my relationship with the Lord Jesus is growing.* 

*“Now I am excited for the group to come back. I am eager to sing and praise with them. Jesus has changed my life, and I am eager to praise Him.”*

What a wonderful story of God’s grace and provision. Thank Him today for the change in this man’s life. Pray more Ethiopians follow in His footsteps.

**There’s more to celebrate tomorrow in Gujarat, India. Meet us there.**
