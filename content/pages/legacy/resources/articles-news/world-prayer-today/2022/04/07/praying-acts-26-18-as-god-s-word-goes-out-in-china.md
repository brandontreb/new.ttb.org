 Praying Acts 26:18 as God’s Word goes out in China

***“Open their eyes, in order******to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctifiedby faith in Me.”*** -Acts 26:18

More than two million Kazakh people live within the borders of China, with only a handful of them choosing to follow Jesus.

Today as our journey through eastern Asia continues, pray with confidence that God is breaking down the strongholds of Islam that dominate the Kazakh culture and bring precious people to the light of Jesus. Let’s use Acts 26:18 as our guide. 

*Father, open the eyes of the Kazakh people living in China so they will see the difference between dark and light, and choose light. May they realize the difference between Satan and You, and choose You. Thank You that You offer us a chance to be forgiven and a place in Your family, inviting us into the company of those who believe in Jesus. We pray they accept that gift today and join us in following You.*

**You are needed tomorrow as we pray for brothers and sisters in North Korea. We’ll meet you on our knees.**
