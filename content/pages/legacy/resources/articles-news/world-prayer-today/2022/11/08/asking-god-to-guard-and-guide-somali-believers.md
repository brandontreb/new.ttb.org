 Asking God to guard and guide Somali believers

***“Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?”*** -Jeremiah 32:27

For more than 25 years, Somalia has been a safe haven for Islamic militants who relentlessly target Christians. The small number who do come to faith are considered high-value targets of terrorist groups and often are intensely pressured by family members. The result? Most live in carefully guarded secrecy.

In the middle of this spiritual battlefield, THRU the BIBLE is committed to getting God’s Word out each day—and it’s working. As one listener tells us:  


*“I left Islam for Jesus. I listen to your programs and find peace. You are my only interaction with Christians. As I have studied with you, I was surprised and delighted to find our story ends in victory. That alone is worth the price I will pay when I tell my family about my new faith. Please pray for me.”*

Thank God that nothing is too hard for Him, including the guarding and guiding of Somali believers who cling to Him as the storms of persecution rage around them. Pray today for all those who follow Him despite the cost.

**From despising the Word of God to desiring it. Join us for this amazing story as we pray our way through Burundi tomorrow.**
