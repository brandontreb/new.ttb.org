 Surrender isn’t giving up, it’s giving into His timing

***Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.*** -1 Peter 5:6-7

God’s tender care. That’s what we’re celebrating today as our World Prayer journey brings us to Kenya. Rejoice in this letter shared by a listener who hops aboard the Bible Bus with us in his language of Swahili:

*“We had exhausted all the medical options and my wife wasn’t getting better. Finally, we sent her into surgery and surrendered her life to the Lord. We thought she had reached the end. God had other plans. He provided four highly qualified doctors to treat my dear wife out of danger, and there was no operation needed! She now is discharged and came back home.*

*“Through this experience we have learned that surrendering to God isn’t giving up, it’s about giving into His timing. We will travel back to Nairobi early next month for a final checkup. Meanwhile she is under medication. I thank the Lord. We give Him praise for the gift of breath, and the gift that we can trust Him in all matters including life and death.”*

What a powerful story. Today let’s praise God using 1 Peter 5:6-7 as our guide.  


*Father, thank You that when we humble ourselves before You, we can trust You with every detail of our lives. We praise You for listening to our cries and allowing us to place our worries in Your steady hands.* *We surrender all our* *concerns to You today and thank You in advance for Your tender care. In Jesus’ name, amen.*

***A listener in Indonesia is building his life on the firm foundation of God’s Word. Hear his story tomorrow as our journey of praise continues.***
