 Praising God in Poland


November 25, 2022

*“I didn’t follow God’s path. It was never my intention to worship or serve Him, but God disrupted my plans.”*

That’s what we hear from a prisoner in Poland today as we travel the world celebrating the miraculous ways God is working in our lives. Here’s the rest of his story:

*“There is nowhere I can go when I leave prison. Those who I love have turned away from me. I keep writing to them, but there is no answer. I burned those bridges with bad choices. I am thankful to God for the new people I am meeting and for the new things I am learning. Through your program, I see a way forward. In God’s Word I find a new plan for my life. I am thankful to Him for that.”*

What a terrific reminder of the power of God’s Word to change us. Thank Him for the many prisoners in Poland who write to us each month. As they hear of Jesus, may their hearts be softened and they, too, find a new purpose in His plan for their lives.

**God’s doing amazing things in the hearts of Muslims in Somalia. Join us there on Monday as we praise our way through the end of 2022.**
