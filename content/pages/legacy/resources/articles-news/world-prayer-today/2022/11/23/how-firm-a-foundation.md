 How firm a foundation

*How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,   
Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!**What more can He say than to you He hath said,**To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?*

 *“Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,  
For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;* **I’ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,  
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.”**  

 At the beginning of every program, we’re called aboard the Bible Bus with the grand anthem, “How Firm a Foundation.” Have you ever listened to the words? Have you ever wondered why that hymn?  


The simplest answer is that the core of what*THRU the BIBLE* is and what we do is the conviction that the Bible is true and trustworthy. We believe God uses His Word uniquely in each of our lives to transform the way we think, believe, and live. As Dr. McGee often said, “The Bible is God’s communication to man.”  


So today, as our World Prayer Team travels on our knees through Indonesia, let’s thank Him for the power of His Word in the lives of listeners like Pasen in West Java who shares:  


*“I came to the Lord about a year ago, but I was really struggling. I wanted to do the right things but didn’t know where to start and how to give up my old sins. I thought about giving up and going back to my old religion. Quite unexpectedly, I met a man who told me about your programs. What a difference they have made. Understanding God’s Word makes me feel as though I have a foundation upon which I can build and a source of strength to accomplish what needs to be done. Thank you for helping me realize that God speaks to me through His Word, and I can depend on Him to help me on this journey.”*

 **Join us for a “feast of blessings” tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
