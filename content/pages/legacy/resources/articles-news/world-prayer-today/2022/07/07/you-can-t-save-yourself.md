 You can’t save yourself

You can’t save yourself. That’s the hard truth a fellow listener who hops aboard the Bible Bus in Madagascar learned. Here’s the rest of his story:

*“No matter how hard I tried, I always found myself in trouble. I wanted to do right, but I managed to ruin everything. My life was out of control. I began seeking advice, and a pastor told me about Jesus. He said I was trying too hard, that I had to let Jesus save me—that I couldn’t do it on my own. We prayed together and he sent me home with instructions to listen to your programs. When I began to follow your advice, I saw a lot of changes. I am now a follower of Jesus and have given Him the power over my circumstances.”*

Thank God He is in control of the world and our lives. Together let’s pray more people in Madagascar realize that He alone has the power save: 

*Father, thank You that when we confess our sins and ask for Your forgiveness, You will rescue us. As Your Word goes out on THRU the BIBLE, we ask that many in Madagascar welcome Your Son, Jesus Christ, as their Lord and Savior. When they do, help them to surrender complete control of their lives and walk in Your Son’s footsteps by the power of the Holy Spirit. Help us to do that, too. Thank You, Lord, for saving us and for answering our prayers. In the powerful name of Jesus we pray, amen.*
