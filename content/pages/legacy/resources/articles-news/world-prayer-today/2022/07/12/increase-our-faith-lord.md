 Increase our faith, Lord

***And the apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”*** -Luke 17:5

*“My faith has been strengthened through your studies.”* 

That’s the good news we hear from Elana in Guatemala today. Here’s the rest of her email:

*“After each lesson, I love to reflect on God’s Word. He speaks to my heart. I am learning so much. I trust Him more with each verse I read. I pray He brings more people to these studies and increases our faith and confidence in Him.”*

Let’s join Elana in that prayer now:

*Father, even the disciples who walked with Jesus needed You to strengthen their faith. He told them if their faith was only the size of a mustard seed, they could uproot trees and crumble mountains. So, increase our faith and make us movers of mountains. Grow our belief in You alone so that we will be strong and ready to battle against the doubts that arise. We pray in Jesus’ name, amen.*

**Oscar in El Salvador reminds us God can be trusted. Hear more tomorrow as we travel the world on our knees in prayer.**
