 Praying wisdom and discernment for new believers

Our World Prayer journey through North American ends this week with a stop to visit Alex in Canada. He shares:

*“What’s next? That’s what I asked my pastor after I accepted Jesus’s offer to be my Savior and was baptized. He told me I need to listen to your programs. I was happy I could listen in Spanish and like how easy it is if I miss a lesson to find it the next day. I am learning so much, and you are helping me understand God’s plan for my life. I really want to talk about my faith with others, so I will listen. Please pray that I will continue to learn all that I need to know to share Jesus with my family and friends.”*

Thank God for Alex and all the new brothers and sisters joining us on the Bible Bus. Pray for them today, ask God to increase their knowledge and give them the wisdom and discernment they need to share their love for Him with others.

*Heavenly Father, thank You that Your Spirit convicts and guides people to the truth, and that we get to share our love for You with others. As our new brothers and sisters study Your Word, may they grow in Your grace and understand Your ways. (We ask this for ourselves as well.) We pray in Your time they have an opportunity to share Your Word with someone else and know the Holy Spirit is working through them. In Jesus’ name we pray, amen.*

**We’ve got more amazing stories about God’s Word at work. Join us on Monday as we praise and pray our way through Indonesia.**
