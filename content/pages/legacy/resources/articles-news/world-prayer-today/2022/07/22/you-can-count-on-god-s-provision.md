 You can count on God’s provision

***“Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap, which have neither storehouse nor barn; and******God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds?*****”** -Luke 12:24

*“I often wondered if God valued me. I didn’t really find out until my husband left me with our three young daughters.”*

That’s what we hear today as we visit with Danica, a fellow traveler on the Bible Bus. Sit and join us at her favorite café in Serbia as she shares the rest of her story:

*“After the panic settled down, I began reading God’s Word with you and found He was healing my emotional wounds and helping me forgive my ex-husband for physically and mentally abusing me. He gave me new life after all the hardships and troubles.* 

*“Then, I heard your explanations on Luke 12:24 and began to trust Him to take care of our physical needs. He did give us everything we need: clothes, food, and everything else. I know now that I trust Him. He will never let me down and that is why I want to get to know Him even more and better. I feel better when I spend time reading and studying the Bible. When life doesn’t make sense … I’ve learned you can count on God. Thank You for everything. His Word brings great joy, just like your program.”*

Today, pray for all those on the Bible Bus who need a reminder that God cares for them. Ask Him to remind all of us that even in the darkest of moments He is with us,He **holds our provision, and He has a solution for our problems.**Pray each of us draw close to Him. We can rest in the truth that He loves us to the very end and cares for our needs. (Read what Jesus said about this in Matthew 6:25-34.) 

**Meet us on Monday in Jacksonville, Florida, as our prayer journey through North America begins.**
