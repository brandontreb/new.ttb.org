 His faithfulness abides

***Your faithfulness endures to all generations;******You established the earth, and it abides.*** -Psalm 119:90

God is faithful. That’s the message we hear today from a listener who hops aboard the Bible Bus from her home in Madhya Pradesh, India. Here’s her story:

“*Six years ago, we were nonbelievers and had never heard about Jesus Christ. My husband and I were very disturbed because we did not have children after four years of marriage. We had taken a lot of treatments from doctors, but nothing worked. We began to lose hope and our problems were increasing. One day someone from our village shared about the power of Jesus Christ and the gospel of salvation. They asked us to start listening to your program in the Gondi language.* 

*“The first thing we came to know was the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. I and my husband after some months accepted Jesus as our Savior and gave our life to Him. We continued listening to the radio program and prayed. We asked Him for a child but surrendered to His will. We found joy in our lives and hoped for the future. After three years, God blessed us with a child. Today we have two children by the grace of God. We thank Him for these blessings, but most of all thank Him for the gift of salvation in our lives.”*

What a great perspective. God’s salvation is the greatest gift we can ever hope for or accept. As we prepare to celebrate the birth of Jesus in a few days, thank Him also for His death and resurrection that freed us of our sin and makes it possible to live in eternity with Him. Also thank Him that He cares and listens to our heart’s desires. He is intricately involved in the details of our lives. He is faithful! Whatever hurts you today, whatever burden you carry, take it to Him and rest in the promise He gives you in Psalm 119:90.

**Muslims are hearing about Jesus and the results are surprising. Join us tomorrow for more of the story.**
