 Praying against resistance to the gospel in Russia

***And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.*** *-* 2 Corinthians 12:9-11

*“All my life I heard faith was for the weak. But now that I’ve opened my heart to God, I feel stronger than ever. My inner life is being transformed! It’s amazing!”*

That’s the great news we hear from Margarita in Russia as the World Prayer Team prays through eastern Europe this week. Here’s the rest of her story:

*“Growing up, my mother often misquoted the Bible and ridiculed its message. Her attitude was formed by the Soviet authorities, and she was passionate about faith being for the fragile and helpless. I didn’t know how to argue with her, but I could feel that something was wrong with what she was saying.*

*“As I’ve been studying with you, God has been revealing so much. Your latest broadcasts about humility and our power in our weakness through Christ’s strength meant so much. I agreed with what you were saying so strongly that I couldn’t even express it! You were saying exactly what was in my heart. You put words to my feelings. It was a miracle!*

*“How can I convey this to my mother and my brothers? This is such a huge and terrible question for me! They are good people, and they live good lives, but as long as their hearts are closed towards God, they don’t know Him!*

*“I will definitely try to share your program with them, and I pray that your words will enter their hearts and that they will experience the joy of accepting Christ! I’ve only now begun to understand what a joy it is to live and walk in the light of the Lord. To be close to Him and continue getting closer. Thank you for letting me learn the Scriptures with you!”*

As we thank God for the power of His Word in Margarita’s life, let’s pray for her family and all those in Russia (and in our lives) who resist the gospel.

*Father, we lift up the unsaved loved ones of our fellow Bible Bus passengers. It’s not Your desire that they perish, so we ask You to remove all the blinders placed by the enemy that are covering their eyes, ears, minds, and hearts.*

*Give them eyes to see, minds to understand, and hearts to receive, to hear about Your goodness and grace. Help them set aside their doubts, hurts, stubbornness, and pride. We pray they bow at Your feet in repentance and humility. In the name of Jesus, through whom all this is possible, amen.*

***“Stay awake and pray.”*****That’s the encouragement we hear from Stoyan in Bulgaria tomorrow. See you there**!
