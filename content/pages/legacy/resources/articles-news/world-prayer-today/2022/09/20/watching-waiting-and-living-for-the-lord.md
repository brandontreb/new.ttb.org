 Watching, waiting, and living for the Lord


September 20, 2022

***“Watch therefore, for you do not know what******hour your Lord is coming.”*** -Matthew 24:42

*“Stay awake and pray!”*

That’s what Stoyan in Bulgaria learned from his journey on the Bible Bus through the book of Matthew. Here’s more:

*“The last chapters in the book of Matthew are very relevant for the times we live in now. I feel as though I’ve been asleep for a long while, and now I’m awakened. I am committed to studying the Bible and watching, waiting, and living for the Lord. Thank you for your continued assistance in this.”*

What great encouragement. Today as we pray for more Bulgarians to join us on the Bible Bus, let’s pray we too devote our lives to watching, waiting, and living for the Lord.

Like Stoyan, would you like to study Matthew with THRU the BIBLE? We have a resource to help. Download the [Matthew Bible Companion](/docs/default-source/booklets/ttb_matthew-bible-companion.pdf?sfvrsn=c18e1f16_2) and get started today.

**We’ve got a special update from Ukraine tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
