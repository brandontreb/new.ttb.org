 How are you sharing God’s Word with others?

***“******Only fear the Lord, and serve Him in truth with all your heart, for consider what great things He has done for you.”*** -1 Samuel 12:24

Give yourself to prayer. Fear the Lord. Serve Him with all your heart. And always remember what great things He has done for you. That’s the great advice we heard on the Bible Bus today from Samuel as Saul was crowned king. That’s also good advice for us today. 

So, today as we pray our way through Paraguay, let’s thank the Lord for faithful servants and listeners like Graciela who writes:

*“I greet you from the borders of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay where we have one of the seven wonders of the world, Iguazu Falls. I listen on Spotify, and you help me prepare messages for my radio show. I am a local announcer. I greet you with the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Giving thanks to God because I was able to find your teaching. Abundant blessings to all the passengers of this precious Bible Bus.”*

Are you sharing with others what you’re learning in God’s Word? We’d love to hear your story. Send it to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f6b49f949a93b48385b6a2a2b4d8998491). 

**Tomorrow we’re using Psalm 119:15-16 as a guide for our prayer journey through Chile. We’ll meet you there.**
