 Special update from Ukraine


September 21, 2022

***“But as for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive.”*** -Genesis 50:20

Welcome, World Prayer Team. Today as we travel on our knees through eastern Europe, here’s a special update from Pastor Sergey Nakul, the host of a unique [weekly THRU the BIBLE talk show](https://radiom.ua/programms/storinkami-biblii) in Ukraine, produced by our ministry partner, FEBC.

*“There is a saying, ‘When sorrow comes, you will know who your true friends are.’ I can tell you that this definitely applies to the Word of God! In times of sorrow, it’s really a faithful friend who will not leave you or betray you! One thing that has become extremely clear during this war is the power of the Word of God.* 

*“There is nothing like a crisis to show you what is really important. In the first few days of the war, we were in shock. We didn’t know what to do. So, we did the only thing we could think of, we read the Word of God.* 

*“Every day, we would go on the air and read from the Word. The Psalms were especially powerful. People would hear the Word and would call in to our helpline, asking how they could know Jesus. Many of them didn’t know anything about Christianity, but they felt the power in the Word. They felt God. Thank you for your prayers.”*

Keep praying, team, and have confidence God is at work through His Word and His people. As God’s Word goes out, pray in Ukraine many will be saved.

**God is answering our prayers in Lithuania. Learn more tomorrow!**
