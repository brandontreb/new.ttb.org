 Praying Romans 12:2 in Poland


September 23, 2022

***And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.*** -Romans 12:2

How are you being changed as you study God’s Word? A fellow passenger in central Poland recently shared his story:

*“As I go through the Scriptures with you, I’m beginning to better understand God’s holiness and the value of His name. I spend a lot of time reading and journaling on my own. I desire to honor Him in everything I do, so I can be His witness to others. It means changes to my character so I can be more Christ-like. I am not an easy man. I have many faults. I am praying about it and working on it. Will you pray for me, too?”*

What a great request. Today as we pray for this gentleman, pray for all those who join us on the Bible Bus each day. Let’s use Romans 12:2 as our guide.

*Father, we’re too often distracted by things of the world. Help us to become increasingly aware of Your Spirit's promptings in our lives, so that day by day our hearts and minds stay focused on You. We pray Your nature is reflected through our actions and attitudes and our lives transformed daily, by the renewing of our minds through Your Word. Help us to do only those things that are good, acceptable, and perfect in Your sight—for Your praise and glory. In the precious name of Jesus, amen.*

**We’ve got a great journey ahead next week … join us in western Africa.**
