 Less than 1% of people in Uzbekistan follow Jesus

***“And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings,so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring.’*****”**-Acts 17:26-28 

 This is what we pray today as we travel on our knees through Uzbekistan. In a country with nearly 30 million people, less than 1% choose to follow Jesus and more than 55% have yet to hear His name. 

 While that’s a lot of numbers to digest, each one represents a living, breathing person whom God deeply loves. Today thank Him for those in Uzbekistan who seek and find Him. Pray that they grow strong in wisdom and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

 **Spreading God’s Word in Tajikistan isn’t easy. Pray with us tomorrow.**
