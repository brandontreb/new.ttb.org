 Praying Ephesians 1:18-19 in Eritrea


February 02, 2022

***Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things from Your law.*** -Psalm 119:18 

 More than 340 million Christians live in places where they experience high levels of persecution, just for following Jesus. That’s 1 in 8 believers. In Eritrea alone, at least 3,000 are imprisoned. 

Welcome, World Prayer Team, as our journey continues through eastern Africa and we stop and praise God for believers like this one:   


*“I am grateful for your teaching that is my only connection to God. What I have learned recently is that we need to pray before we read the Bible. You have shown us the Bible is not an ordinary book like the others and that the Holy Spirit is the one to reveal its meaning. Thank you for your part in this, too. Please pray for me so I will be faithful in my studies and my eyes will be opened to the truth.”*   


What a great request. Let’s pray now, using Ephesians 1:18-19 as our guide. 

*Father, as we study Your Word today and every day on the Bible Bus, we ask that the eyes of our hearts will be open and receptive to the hope to which You call each of us, the riches of Your glorious inheritance, and Your incomparably great power for everyone who believes in You. In Jesus’ name, amen.*   


The discipline of prayer before we study the Bible is Dr. McGee’s first guideline in his booklet, [“How to Understand the Bible.”](/docs/default-source/Booklets/how-to-understand-the-bible_ttb.pdf?sfvrsn=c29d1d16_2) Want to learn more about the importance of prayer as we open God’s Word and the six other guidelines he suggests?

 **Tomorrow a grieving mother asks us to pray for her. Join us in Uganda.**
