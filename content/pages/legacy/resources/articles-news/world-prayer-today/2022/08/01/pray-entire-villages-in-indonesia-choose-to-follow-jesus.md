 Pray entire villages in Indonesia choose to follow Jesus

***That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world.*** -John 1:9

To be Sunda is to be Muslim. Many believe that if someone is no longer a Muslim, they are no longer Sunda and they can be kicked out of their village. 

That’s the hard reality we learn about as we travel on our knees through the Indonesian island of West Java. Yet, God’s Word is changing listeners like Ade who shares:

*“I heard your teaching on John 1:9-14. I learned much from your words. I know now that people cannot free themselves from the darkness that binds them, so Jesus came to the world to free us. The birth of Jesus (who brings light) is an amazing gift for us. It is one that I have accepted and cannot wait to learn more about.”*

Thirty-eight million Sundanese live on the westernmost part of Java. As you thank God for the light of Jesus in your life and Ade’s, pray He makes His way into their hearts as well. May entire families and villages hear God’s Word on THRU the BIBLE and choose to follow Jesus. 

**Put your armor on and prepare to pray your way through the spiritual battlefield of Myanmar tomorrow.**
