 Setting aside distractions and focusing on Jesus

***Whom have I in heaven but You?******And there is none upon earth that I desire besides You.*** -Psalm 73:25

*“Growing older has made some things more difficult, but I have found that it has also made many things simple.”*

That’s the wisdom Anita in Punjab, India, shares as our prayer journey through southern Asia continues. Here’s more of her story:

*“I used to share about God’s love to many people when I was physically fit. Now with old age and knee problems, I am not able to walk around. I can’t go to church regularly because it is quite far from my place. In spite of all these hindrances, I thank God because I can listen to His Word from the comfort of my home. I feel that the church is at my home. It satisfies all my spiritual needs. I used to go many places and do many things, now I realize that spending time with God is more than enough.”*

Today as we come before the Lord and lift up His Word as it goes out in the language of Punjabi, let’s meditate on Psalm 73:25. As you pray, ask God to help you each day to set aside all the distractions of life and for a few moments be able to focus solely on Him. Like Anita, may this practice bring us to the realization that there’s nothing on this earth we desire more than Him.

**A family faces financial ruin and finds faith. Hear more tomorrow on World Prayer Today.**
