 God already knows the outcome

***For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.*** -Colossians 1:16-17

*“My father and I argued a lot when he would not allow me to attend church or be together with my Christian friends. These disagreements were the cause of much stress within our family.”*

Welcome, Word Prayer Team. Today as we pray our way through the Philippines, we sit with a wise young man named Tommy. Here’s the rest of his story.

*“After a particularly bad fight, I was very discouraged. Noticing my sadness, a neighbor suggested I begin listening to your programs. It’s been about a year, and I have learned much. I have stopped arguing with my father, and while he still doesn’t allow me to attend church, I am able to see my friends.* 

*“Through your teaching of God’s Word, I have learned God is in control. He made the heavens and the earth, and He already knows the outcome of this situation. I now have to trust Him to work it out. Please pray God changes my father’s mind and my entire family will one day attend church together.”*

Like Tommy, is there something you need to trust God with today? As you surrender it to Him, intercede for all those on the Bible Bus who are waiting on God to work in their lives as well. Ask Him to give us the patience to wait on Him and the faith to believe He is before all things and we are safe within His capable hands. 

**Are you discouraged? Don’t give up. That’s the message we hear next week in Equatorial Guinea. Meet us here as we pray.**
