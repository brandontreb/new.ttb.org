 Praying for Muslims in Chad

***For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.*** -2 Corinthians 2:15

When God’s Word goes out on THRU the BIBLE, we never know who is listening … but we’re always delightfully surprised by the results. Today as we pray on our knees through the country of Chad, thank God for Muslims like this one who are listening and learning alongside us on the Bible Bus. 

*“I am a Muslim, not a Christian, but I enjoy listening to you in French from time to time. Each time your voice is like a pleasant visitor helping me to understand the ancient and Holy Scriptures. I now have a clearer understanding of the Bible.”*

More than 50% of Chadians identify themselves as Muslim, and more than 55% of them are unreached with the Good News of Jesus Christ. Pray God’s Word and His people are a sweet and alluring fragrance to those He is drawing to Himself.

**Our prayer journey tomorrow takes us to Angola where we learn about the plight of vulnerable people there.**
