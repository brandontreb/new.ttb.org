 Pray for new hearts in Taiwan


August 26, 2022

***“I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.”*** -Ezekiel 36:26 

New hearts. That’s what we’re praying for in Taiwan today. On our previous prayer treks, we’ve learned the majority of the Taiwanese population follow a unique blend of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. And Christian growth has been slow, with only an estimated 6% of islanders claiming to follow Christ. Today as we pray for God’s Word as it goes out to the Taiwanese people, let’s begin with Ezekiel 36:26. 

*Father, please give a new heart and put a new spirit in all those who believe in Your Name in Taiwan. Remove their hearts of stone and give each of them a heart of flesh. Draw them near, so that as You call, they hear Your voice and obey. In the precious name of Jesus we pray, amen.*

**We’re praying alongside a domestic violence survivor on Monday in Peru. Please join us for the journey.**
