 Praying for restoration in DRC


August 12, 2022

**“Every great movement of God can be traced to a kneeling figure.”** -D.L. Moody

*“**I am a loyal listener, and we are in the book of Judges talking about Gideon. It especially fascinates me as I work in the courts. Much reform is needed in our country, and God is the only one I know who is capable. Please pray for us.”*

That’s what we hear from a fellow listener as our prayer travels bring us to the beautiful and somewhat broken country of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Are you up for the challenge? Let’s kneel together:

*Father, thank You for our brothers and sisters in DRC. Their needs are many, and we’re comforted that You know and care about each one.* *We pray You transform the hearts of those who cause conflict, bring safety to the vulnerable, and restore the livelihoods of those who* *have nothing. Above all else we pray that Your name is known and Your people* *hear the truth of Your Word and it brings them life, both in this hurting nation and for eternity. In the precious name of Jesus, amen.*

**Get excited! God’s name is getting out in unlikely places. Pray with us next week through southern Asia.**
