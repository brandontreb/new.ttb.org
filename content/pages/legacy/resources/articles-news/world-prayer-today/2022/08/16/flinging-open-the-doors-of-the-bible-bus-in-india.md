 Flinging open the doors of the Bible Bus in India

*“Someone once told me that if I wanted to know God, I had to know His Word. So that is why I turned to you.”*

That’s what we hear from a listener of THRU the BIBLE’S Kannada language program. Here’s more of her encouraging story:

*“I am a teacher, so I listen every day as I take the train to work. Right now, we are studying the book of Revelation. As I listen and read the Word of God, it brings me more insight and understanding. I am all the more blessed to share what I’m learning with my husband when I return home. At night I read the book of Exodus to my five-year-old son. I’m finding it as a reflection of the book of Revelation. I am all the more eager to read and compare. I am overwhelmed and grateful for your ministry. Keep speaking hope to our nation.”* 

Praise God for the growing faith of this listener and her family. As we pray for God’s Word as it goes out in what many call south India’s most spiritually needy state, as the doors of the Bible Bus open, pray droves of people hop aboard. 

**A listener in Punjab, India, has important wisdom to share. Join us as our travels continue.**
