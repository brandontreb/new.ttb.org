 A new beginning for Iraq broadcasts

Welcome to the World Prayer Team. Thanks to the intercession of God’s people, light is shining into the darkest of places—like in northern Iraq. 


Three years ago and after many challenges, *Thru the Bible* began airing in the Kurdish language, hoping to reach people who live near Irbil, an area suffering from great unrest and regular and dramatic persecution of Christians. 


“All the people are afraid now,” said a man on the street of Irbil. “Many have fled to the Kurdistan region and others went abroad. We will most definitely see chaos.” According to refugee relief agencies, more than 3 million Iraqis have been displaced from their home, running for their lives from militants. An estimated 11 million need humanitarian help.


Here are some ideas on how to pray today for the Kurdish people: 


* First, intercede for Iraqis displaced from their homes and pray for those who remain, that they would come across God’s Word of hope and life. Pray that they are drawn by the truth in a way that they know God is at work in their lives. Intercede for their safety and their courage.
* Pray for the safety of our Kurdish producer.
* Pray for peace and political stability throughout the Middle East and North Africa so that the gospel may continue on air without disruption.


Prayer is a powerful weapon. Use it today to combat the darkness.


**Join us next week as we pray our way through northeast Asia.**
