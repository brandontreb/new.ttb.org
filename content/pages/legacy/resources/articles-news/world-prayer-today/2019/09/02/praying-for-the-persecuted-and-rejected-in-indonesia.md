 Praying for the persecuted and rejected in Indonesia


September 02, 2019

On the 17,000 islands that comprise the nation of Indonesia, choosing to follow Jesus can be a difficult decision.


As one listener tells us:


*“I have thought and searched and have decided to surrender my life to Jesus. Although my neighbors do not like me to go to church, I will do it anyway. Praise the Lord I can listen to the words of God on radio and on an audio mini box whenever I feel like and without judgement. I feel happy when I listen to your Sundanese program. It is as though God is with me, personally guiding me through His Word. Please pray! Many oppose my belief, but I wish to remain strong and thoroughly devoted to our Lord.”*


Known as the world’s most populous Muslim nation, many Christians in Indonesia face persecution and rejection. Today let’s pray that God’s Word heard on *Thru the Bible* in Javanese, Madurese, Indonesian, and Sundanese is a source of comfort and strength to them.


**Our World Prayer journey continues tomorrow. Join us as we visit with a grieving wife in the Philippines.**
