 “I am still Muslim, but not for long…”


August 30, 2019

In Habakkuk 2:14, God promises that *“the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”* In Maharashtra, India, a Muslim man tells us that he is hearing the good news about Jesus Christ. 


Pray for him and others like him who are discovering the truth about God. 


He says: 


*“I am still Muslim, but not for long. I like to watch your programs on the internet. You speak of the works of all the prophets including Jesus Christ, but you never speak of Muhammad the prophet of Islam, yet he created terror in the world. There is much to say about him. I have my doubts that he was a worthy prophet of God. Some say he was a deceiver. I hope I’ll soon discover the truth. Thank you for your excellent work in enlightening humanity and chasing away the darkness that clouds their minds. Remember me before your God.”*


Yes, we will remember him. Pray right now, would you? 


**Join the team next week as we continue to pray across Southeast Asia. Remember these requests before the throne over the weekend.**
