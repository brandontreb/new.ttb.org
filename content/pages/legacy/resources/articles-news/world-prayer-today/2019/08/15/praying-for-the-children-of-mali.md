 Praying for the children of Mali


August 15, 2019

Welcome, World Prayer Team! Today we land in the country of Mali where a “member” of our World Prayer Team has asked us to pray for her country. 


She writes:


*“I pray for you always. To know that our prayers are granted gives me strength and courage to follow God even when I am tested. I hope others have been strengthened too. Your broadcasts in my language of Bambara give me a lot of hope and I walk in the ways of God through your words. Please pray for my country and for our children. We need God’s presence to save us from destruction.”*


Isn’t it great to hear from a fellow prayer warrior? Join her in asking God to make His presence known in the country of Mali, especially in the hearts of the children who make up more than 50% of the population. Let’s also pray for the children in our own lives. May God’s Word take root in their hearts and be a constant guide as they grow and blossom in His love.


**Our week-long prayer journey through Africa ends tomorrow in Botswana. Join us.**
