 When your child is sick . . .


June 17, 2019

In areas of the world like India, people risk personal safety and social acceptance when they turn to Jesus. 


Pray for parents of young families who step out in faith in Jesus when they have nowhere else to turn. Like Ilesh and his wife:


*“Neither my wife nor I knew Jesus. But all this changed when our son suddenly fell extremely sick and no amount of medicines and treatments seemed to cure him. All our finances went in to medical bills and we soon became debtors. This caused us a lot of tension and worry. During this time we started listening to* Thru the Bible *and came to know about Jesus Christ. We learned about how He gave sight to a blind man and we decided to put our trust and faith in Him. We also visited a child of God in our village and shared with him about our situation. He prayed for my son and shared more about Jesus Christ with us.* 


*“By God’s grace, my son was soon healed and we, as a family, accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. Kindly pray for my family members who do not believe in Christ that they might also come to the amazing saving grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.”*


Praise God for His healing hand and how He uses miracles like this to turn people’s attention to their need and His answer. 


**Tomorrow, we continue traveling on our knees through India where God is doing an amazing work.**
