 Equipping missionaries in India


June 18, 2019

Despite hardship, God’s Word will go out and accomplish His purposes. 


Today we celebrate how God is bringing people in the remote villages of India to an understanding of their need for a Savior. Your fellow Bible Bus rider, Anil, writes to thank you for your supportive prayer. 


*“For the last seven years, my wife and I have been working as missionaries in remote villages in our country. She works with a government project for children and I travel and teach God’s Word to people who never heard about Jesus. I am writing to thank you for your program. What wonderful teaching—interesting and systematic. I am applying what I learn to my work in the village areas, instructing me in the depth of God’s Word, and for counseling people in the hardships of life. I am eager to listen every day because I believe it is how God equips me for service. Thank you for your team of intercessors. Please join me in prayer support of the people in my six villages, that many people would come to the Lord Jesus Christ.”*


Continue to lift up indigenous Christian workers in India like Anil who extend great effort and cost to follow the Lord’s calling on their lives. 


**Share in the joy of God at work in India, tomorrow on our knees.**
