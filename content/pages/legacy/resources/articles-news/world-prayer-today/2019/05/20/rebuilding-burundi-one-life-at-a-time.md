 Rebuilding Burundi one life at a time

Welcome to World Prayer Today. We’re in beautiful Burundi, Africa, today—traveling around the world on our knees. 


Haven’t heard of Burundi? Rwanda is their neighbor to the north, Tanzania to the east and south, and the mysterious Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. Burundi is one of the world’s poorest nations in the world, with 8 out of 10 people living below the poverty line.


For over 400 years, Burundi has suffered from the conflict between the Tutsi and Hutu tribes. Nearly 200,000 refugees have fled their homes to Tanzania. A half a million children in Burundi have lost at least one parent to war or disease, and since the genocides between the Tutsi and Hutus of the 1990’s, almost every home has lost someone they loved among the 250,000+ murdered. 


All of this poverty and violence has left deep-seated tensions among the people of Burundi. Many claim to be Christians, but most trained Bible teachers, pastors, and missionaries left when violence broke out years ago. 


Recently, this email from a young Burundi listener describes how God is using His Word to rebuild a nation. 


*“I am pleased to tell you that your Bible teaching program is a great treasure for your listeners. I am confident that with your prayers God will do wonders. I am a student at Burundi University and hope to someday help rebuild my nation.”*


Pray today for the people of Burundi whose only hope is in Jesus Christ. 


**We continue tomorrow on our knees through Africa. Praise God, He hears our petitions.**
