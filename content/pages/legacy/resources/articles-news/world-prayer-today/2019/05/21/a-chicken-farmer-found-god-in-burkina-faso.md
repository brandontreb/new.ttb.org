 A chicken farmer found God in Burkina Faso


May 21, 2019

Meet Ahmen—a wonderful chicken farmer who found God in the capital city of Burkina Faso. You’re going to love his story. 


*“I am a listener of Sinai radio. I breed poultry for my living, and it’s during my work that* Thru the Bible *is on the radio. When the hour arrives, I stop all activities to listen. I like this program because it is the school of wisdom; I take your advice for life because the message is true and transforms the character. Today I understand God differently and I try to put His truth I receive into practice. Only God makes me feel very well in my mind and in my soul. No one can listen to this broadcast and remain the same as before. Jesus loves to the extent that He did not spare His own life, and in turn I gave Him my life. Now I am a child of God.”*


We can say “amen” to that. What a wonderful testimony of how God uses His Word to transform our lives. Pray for men and women like Ahmen in Burkina Faso to reach out—and find God. 


**Tomorrow we continue finding people to love and support in prayer in our journey through Africa.**
