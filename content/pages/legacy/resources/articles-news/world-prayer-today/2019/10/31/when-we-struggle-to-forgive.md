 When we struggle to forgive


October 31, 2019

Ephesians 4:32 says, *“Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.”*


Welcome to Mozambique. Today on our World Prayer journey we meet a listener who asks for our prayer as she tries to forgive someone who has hurt her deeply. Listen to her story:


“‘*Lord, change my heart.’* *That’s my constant prayer. I love God and I know He wants me to forgive, but the father of my children has hurt me so much. His unkindness can be unbearable.* *Your lessons in Ephesians are helping, but I still cannot forgive. How can I do it? Please pray for me. I want to please God and release myself from this anger.”*


Today let’s pray for all those who struggle to forgive. May God grant us His peace and give us the strength we need to love others as He does. 


**Our journey through Africa ends tomorrow in Swaziland. We hope you’ll meet us there.**
