 God’s Word exposes lies in Lithuania


October 14, 2019

As the first republic to declare its independence from the USSR in 1990, Lithuania is a proud and independent nation. 


Political freedom from the Soviets also brought Lithuanians religious freedom, but since then cult and theological falsehoods have abounded. But praise God His Word clears up misconceptions and exposes the lies. As one listener named Jolita tells us:


*“I am grateful for your wonderful teachings from the Word of God. They touch my heart and revive my soul. Truth is hard to find, and it is so good that we can hear it every day on the radio, and that we can listen on your website too. I once was so confused about what was right, but you have shown me that I can know truth for myself by reading the Bible. Through your teachings I have accepted Jesus as my Savior and I now live for Him. I promise to tell others about your programs so they will know the truth and won’t be confused by the many who try to deceive.”*


Praise God for the truth of His Word! Pray that more people in Lithuania hear His Word and turn away from false theologies and teachings. 


**It’s a joy to pray alongside you. Join us tomorrow as we travel on our knees to Romania.**
