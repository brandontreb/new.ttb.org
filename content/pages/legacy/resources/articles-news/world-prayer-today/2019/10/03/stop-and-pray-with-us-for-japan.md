 Stop and pray with us for Japan

*“Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us.”*   - Ephesians 3:20


If you’ve been a member of the World Prayer Team for long, then you know broadcasting God’s Word in Japan can be difficult. But we’re grateful that when God provides a vision, He also provides a way to accomplish it. 


Today let’s take a moment to praise and thank God for the few FM stations where *Thru the Bible* can be heard in Japan, and then ask that His Word be effective in reaching those who seek Him there:


*Father, Thank You for hearing our prayers—we love You and call upon Your name. Together we lift up those who need You in Japan. We ask that You would reach them with the good news of Your mercy and grace. Thank You that despite the obstacles of man, you continue to provide ways for people in Japan to hear of the Good News of Your Son, Jesus. We pray that all those who hear His name will turn to You in faith and repentance. Please strengthen and encourage our Japanese producer, Hiroyuki Fukuda. Make His ministry fruitful so that You can be glorified. We ask this in Your Son’s powerful name, amen.* 


**God hears us when we pray—that’s why we’re grateful for your partnership as we travel the world on our knees. Join us tomorrow as we pray for *Thru the Bible’s* effectivenessin China.**
