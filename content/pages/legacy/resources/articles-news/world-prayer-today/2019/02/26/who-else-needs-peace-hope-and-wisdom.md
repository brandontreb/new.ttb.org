 Who else needs peace, hope, and wisdom?


February 26, 2019

*“You have encouraged me in my sadness. You have accompanied me in my solitude. You have comforted me in my disease.”*


Those are the meaningful words a listener of *Thru the Bible*’s broadcast in Quito, Ecuador, shares with us today. He continues, 


*“**Every morning I listen to your studies on the Internet. They have given me a lot of peace, hope, and wisdom. I really want to know the Word of God more and more. And you know how to explain it very clearly and simply. In six months, I have learned a lot and know that the Lord Jesus has spoken to me through you and has strengthened me.”*


Isn’t that a great letter? Let’s pray that more listeners in Ecuador will realize the hope and peace God offers us through His Son, Jesus. 


And let’s also pray for the effectiveness of *Thru the Bible*’s Quichua language broadcasts in Ecuador. In 1967, only 120 people of the 3 million Quichua were Christians. Today in some areas, almost 50 percent of the Quichua people have come to know Christ as their personal Savior! Let’s boldly ask the Lord to double that number!


**Our prayer journey continues tomorrow in the West Indies. Invite your friends to join us at** [**TTB.org/pray**](http://www.TTB.org/pray)**.**
