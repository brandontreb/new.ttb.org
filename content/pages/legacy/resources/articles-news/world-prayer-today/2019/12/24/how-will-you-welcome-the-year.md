 How will you welcome the year?


December 24, 2019

*“Thank you all for your presence on the radio on Christmas and New Year´s Eve. I was very pleased to turn on the radio and listen to* Som do Livro [*Portuguese* Thru the Bible].” 


That’s what Paulo wrote us about how he celebrated the new year. He continues, 


*“My family is in heaven and I am new to this city and so have little fellowship. I thank God for His Word and His people globally who bring good news of comfort and joy.”* 


Look around you today to find someone who might be going through life alone. Like Paulo, they likely would love the gift of good news and comfort your kind words can bring. 


And pray for the people of Portugal who hunger after the Word of God and a living and growing relationship with the Lord.


**Celebrate the joy of Christmas Day with us tomorrow, as our prayer journey continues.**
