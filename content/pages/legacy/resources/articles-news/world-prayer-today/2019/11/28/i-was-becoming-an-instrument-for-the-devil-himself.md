 “I was becoming an instrument for the devil himself…”


November 28, 2019

In John 8:32, Jesus promises*, “And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”* That’s what we’re celebrating in India today. 


Listen to this wonderful letter from a listener who hears our Bhojpuri program from her home in Uttar Pradesh:


*“My family’s religion is strongly rooted in demonic rituals and worship. At that time, I was not aware that I was becoming an instrument for the devil himself. I was under demonic oppression and many spiritual attacks. My husband took me to several witch doctors to be freed, but it was in vain. My physical health began to deteriorate, and my family grew extremely worried for me.* 


*“About that time, my husband ran into a Christian friend at the market. After he came to know about my condition, he came to my house to pray for me. I became more violent as the prayers increased. I tried to run away from these prayers. But the prayer won in the end. I became calm and quieted down. He visited us the next day, prayed for us again, and also explained the Bible to us… He invited us to listen to your programs.* 


*“Through God’s Word we really feel as though we have been set free. Set free from our bondage, set free from our sin … set free from our former life that was leading us to nothing. I thank you for helping me to know Jesus Christ and to experience His love and eternal life.”*


Praise God that His promises are true! Today as we celebrate God’s work in our lives and the lives of others around the world, let’s join this listener in thanking God that He is the truth and He does indeed set us free!


**There’s so much more to celebrate; join us tomorrow as the World Prayer Team travels to Florida.**
