 Pray with us now…


November 15, 2019

As one of the last states in India to open to missionaries, the people of Madhya Pradesh are beginning to respond to the gospel. But strict laws limiting conversion from Hinduism to Christianity make it difficult to reach people.


So as we pray our way through what many consider the untouched heartland of India, we stop and pray for Ramesh Bhabhor, *Thru the Bible’s* producer of the Bhili language. But first there are a few things you should know about the Bhil people.


* They are India’s second largest tribe.
* Worldwide Bhils number 11.9 million, with five million of them living in Madhya Pradesh.
* The Bhils’ native religion is Hinduism with an animistic influence.


Let’s pray together now.


*Father, we come before You in faith, believing You love the Bhil people and desire them to be saved. We ask You to bless the ministry of Ramesh Bhabhor and soften the hearts of all those who hear* Thru the Bible *in the Bhili language. As Ramesh ministers to others, we pray You will minister to him. Encourage him and give his body strength to fight the disease of diabetes from which he suffers. Help him to know You are near. In Jesus’ name, amen.* 


**That’s all for us this week, we’ll see you on Monday as we praise God and celebrate the work He is doing in the lives of listeners around the world.**
