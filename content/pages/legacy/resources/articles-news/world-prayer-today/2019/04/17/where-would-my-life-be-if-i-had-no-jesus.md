 “Where would my life be if I had no Jesus?”

*“Where would my life be if I had no Jesus?”*


No matter where you live, life is hard. In Botswana, HIV is having an epidemic-level impact—touching more than one quarter of the population. Yet in spite of his health, one brother who listens to the Tswa broadcast of *Thru the Bible* writes: 


*“**Though my body is collapsing like a tent, God’s love has changed me from the inside. Thank you, wonderful God, for Thy mercy, and for the privilege of listening to Your holy Word. I am here to testify that the grace of God is sufficient. I also thank God’s mercy that is renewed every day. Jesus’ love for me is all that sustains me! The death of Jesus is very precious to me because it means I have the right to enter the presence of God. I recognize that even the wealthiest men never have enough to pay for their own salvation. Only the blood of Jesus frees us from the guilt of sin.”*


Our African brother closes his letter with this prayer—let’s echo it:


*“Beloved God, I bow before Thee, to thank You for Your Son’s death that brings us salvation. Allow us the strength and will to tirelessly proclaim this gospel to our brothers, amen.”*


**Join us tomorrow as we thank God for new life in Pennsylvania. It’s always a miracle.**
