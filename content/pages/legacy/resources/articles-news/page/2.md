This year we’ve watched the escalating crisis in the Ukraine on the news and we’ve prayed, we’ve rallied, we’ve cried at the images, and we’ve cheered the courage and faithfulness of those who stand for God, no matter which side they’re on.

Called the man after God’s own heart, shepherd boy, and king, David experienced many storms in life. His story can be a great encouragement to you when you face trials and when problems seem to block your progress. You can read his story and know that he had similar problems. Yet born out of this life often touched by trouble, David was used by God to give us the hymnbook of the Bible, the book of Psalms—a beautiful, nuanced, and rich collection of how to praise God.
