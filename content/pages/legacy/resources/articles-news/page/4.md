The Gospel of John is one of the easiest books to read, yet one of the most profound Gospels to understand. We might get the surface meaning easily enough, but to understand the deep truths, we need the Lord Jesus to be our teacher.

## [Living in a World that Has Forgotten God](../features/2022/01/28/living-in-a-world-that-has-forgotten-god)

When the Lord taught the parable of the sower, He said the seed that fell on the rock had “fallen away.” Literally, the seed grew without a root. He likened it to the person who believes for a little while and then falls when temptation strikes. (See Luke 8:13.) 
People who “fall away” are called “apostates” in Scripture. They professed to believe, but then they move away from it. They no longer believe; they have departed from the faith.

In Numbers we see the children of Israel leave Mount Sinai and march to Kadesh Barnea. After a big failure there, God sent them to wander in the wilderness until that generation died. These years of wandering told a saga of suffering, a trek of tragedy, and a story of straying. The lessons they had to learn are good for us to hear, too, which is why God recorded this history. Pay attention!

When God made His covenant with Abraham, He said, "I will bless you … so that you will be a blessing" (see Genesis 12:2).

The principle certainly follows for us, too. As God blesses us, we want to bless others.

Your family tree may explain a lot about you—where you came from, who your grandfather was, and his father before him. Luke’s Gospel traces Jesus’ family through Mary’s story, back to King David, then back all the way to Adam, the first created son of God. But Adam fell from that lofty position when he sinned. Jesus Christ, the last Adam and the Son of God, came to bring mankind back into that relationship with God by believing on Him—the only way to be in fellowship with God.
