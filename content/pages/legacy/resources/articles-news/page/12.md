Thru the Bible’s mission is a wonderful and grand plan. Its depth (the whole Word) and scope (the whole world) defies manmade strategies—we have to do it God’s way to succeed. Some call this “God room”—the space between what we can do on our own and what could only happen if God steps in.

Most of us will admit to our shame that we worry. We know the Bible says it’s wrong, even sinful, but we still do it. Here’s our opportunity to change our ways. Instead of worrying, let’s pray about everything.

We may never hear a lot of great stories of how God is working in Japan, but our partner there reminded me, “Don’t forget about the one.” Jesus told us about the shepherd who left the 99 to find the one lost sheep (Matthew 18:12-14).

## [Why Study Proverbs?](../features/2018/11/22/why-study-proverbs)


November 22, 2018
![Proverbs headline](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Why-Study/proverbs-headline.jpg?sfvrsn=7b381e16_0 "Proverbs headline")
“The purpose of God’s Word is to point us to Jesus. We don’t read the Bible as some self-help book, we read it to get a better picture of God’s character. Proverbs is the most intensely practical book in the Bible, filled with wisdom for everyday issues but it begins with “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” This isn’t just good advice—wisdom is a way to see Jesus.” --Dr. J. Vernon McGee

![two sheep grazing](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Features-and-News/two-sheep-grazing.jpg?sfvrsn=de41d16_0 "two sheep grazing")
The Psalms express the deepest emotions of shepherds and kings, prophets and priests, as they wrestle with loss, disillusionment, celebration, and the hope of eternal life with the God who made them. But more than anything, the Psalms picture a new way to see Jesus Christ.

## [Why Study Galatians?](../features/2018/07/04/why-study-galatians)


July 04, 2018
![Galatians headline](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Why-Study/galatians-headline.jpg?sfvrsn=1aee1d16_0 "Galatians headline")
When you "think Galatians, think grace." That's what the first readers of this letter from the apostle Paul were prompted to think. These first-century Jews who followed Jesus forgot that Jesus had saved them by grace, rather than by the Law of Moses. They also forgot that Christian Gentiles came to faith in Christ the same way they did.

![North Korean boy on bike](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Features-and-News/north-korean-boy-on-bike.jpg?sfvrsn=32ee1d16_0 "North Korean boy on bike")
Hardly a day goes by that North Korea (called The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) isn’t a focus of world news. Known as the "Hermit Kingdom," North Korea has isolated its people from the outside world for 50 years, and so this added exposure is drawing attention.

The story of Job is about perseverance: How does a faithful man walk with God in the middle of suffering? He didn't know that he was being watched by God and Satan. He didn't know God would restore all that had been taken away. Job trusted God in the darkest hours of his life. Over 25 times he asked God, "Why?"--without any explanation. In the end, Job discovered God was worthy of his trust.
