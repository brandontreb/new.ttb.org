## [Let God’s Love Hold You Up: For those who are suffering](../features/2018/05/24/let-god-s-love-hold-you-up-for-those-who-are-suffering)

The book of Job should never be entered lightly, but thoughtfully . . . compassionately. The same is true whenever we meet someone who is walking in the valley of shadows, of pain, or of death or even of setbacks and discouragement. Perhaps you’re there now. In this fragile place where questions about God and about life’s meaning and purpose fill your thoughts, our teacher, Dr. J. Vernon McGee, has a word of counsel: Let the love of God hold you up.

## [Why Study Esther?](../features/2018/05/18/why-study-esther)


May 18, 2018
![Esther headline](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Why-Study/esther-headline.jpg?sfvrsn=5afb1d16_0 "Esther headline")
In a time of exile when Israel had forgotten about God, the book of Esther proves that God had not forgotten about them. God's ongoing providence is on display in the least likely circumstances. A great story, and even better that it's actually true!

## ["P" is for Providence](../features/2018/04/25/p-is-for-providence)

If there’s one thing the book of Esther teaches us, it’s that God is in control. Of the universe. Of the history of mankind. Of our individual lives. Let’s take a closer look at this sovereign ordering of our history that happens whether we acknowledge God’s hand or not.

In the fall of 2017, Thru the Bible’s president, Gregg Harris, traveled to Italy and Spain to meet with the TTB producers of our Italian, European Spanish, and European Portuguese ministries. “While Western Europe is ‘hard ground,’” Gregg says, “we are encouraged how God’s Word is taking root in the lives of our listeners.”

## [5 Lessons from Nehemiah on Serving God](../features/2018/03/27/5-lessons-from-nehemiah-on-serving-god)


March 26, 2018

If you’ve ever looked at a messy situation and thought, “someone ought to do something,” you’ll understand the passion Nehemiah felt for Jerusalem. From distant Persia (modern day Iran), Nehemiah heard that its walls lay in rubble, even decades after the Jews returned home. But what could he do? That’s the question you may have when you consider some big need you see in your church or ministry or community. You want to do something, but what can you do?

## [Why Study Ezra & Nehemiah](../features/2018/03/26/why-study-ezra-nehemiah-part-1)


March 26, 2018
![Ezra & Nehemiah headline](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Why-Study/ezra-amp-nehemiah-headline.jpg?sfvrsn=998b1d16_0 "Ezra & Nehemiah headline")
The events of Ezra and Nehemiah took place in a significant time in world history. The spiritual and cultural dynamics of this last century of the Old Testament demand a closer look at the books of the Bible in context with global history. God's hand was moving among men--and man's heart was moving either toward or away from God's heart.

## [When Love is Hard](../features/2018/02/26/when-love-is-hard)

You don’t need lessons on how to love when you’re with loveable people. Love comes easily—or at least easier. It’s when you’re surrounded by stinkers that it gets hard. The book of 1 Corinthians was written to those kinds of people. Bickering. Back-biters. Gossipers. Spiritual babies. A prideful pack of people. First Corinthians is called Paul’s “hard letter” by Bible teachers, Dr. McGee included. In our daily journey on the Bible Bus this month, we’ll learn all about the surprising similarities between the church in Corinth and our own churches today.

## [Why Study 1 & 2 Corinthians](../features/2018/02/20/why-study-1-2-corinthians)


February 20, 2018
![Corinthians headline](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Why-Study/corinthians-headline.jpg?sfvrsn=a6911d16_0 "Corinthians headline")
"The church at Corinth had serious problems. They had lost sight of the main objective: To share the person of Jesus Christ. They had forgotten about the centrality of Christ crucified and His rightful place as Lord of their lives. As a consequence, they felt overwhelmed. That was the problem then and it is the problem today."

Everybody relates to the need to get back on track—to renew our commitment to what we once knew was important, whether that is an exercise routine or a way of eating, or spending, or—especially—to our commitment to spend time with God in His Word.

## ["A Muslim Imam walked into our church and said..."](../news/2018/01/29/a-muslim-imam-walked-into-our-church-and-said-)

Last year about this time, *Thru the Bible* began airing in Uganda in the Luganda language, though there it’s called Mmanya Baibuliyo. As a reflection of the power of God’s Word, look what happened almost right away.

## [Why Study 1 & 2 Chronicles?](../features/2018/01/10/why-study-1-2-chronicles)


January 10, 2018
![Chronicles headline](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Why-Study/chronicles-headline.jpg?sfvrsn=5ba41d16_0 "Chronicles headline")
When God’s people were disciplined and fragmented, the stories of David and Solomon were retold as an encouragement to come back together to be God’s people, set apart for His purposes. The stories of Chronicles cast a renewed vision of how to live in a blessed relationship with God.

## [What Does it Mean to Really Worship?](../features/2017/12/27/what-does-it-mean-to-really-worship)

![Crowd with hands reaching up](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Features-and-News/crowd-with-hands-reaching-up.jpg?sfvrsn=c5a41d16_0 "Crowd with hands reaching up")
Buried in the historical books of 1 and 2 Chronicles is a practical primer on how to worship God. It shouldn’t surprise us, since Chronicles was written to call people back to the Lord and to remind them of all the wonderful things God had done for them and why He is worthy of our worship. *In a nutshell, that is what worship is—reflecting back to God what we think He’s worth.*

My friend, look about you. The supermarkets are groaning with their shelves laden down. The department stores are bulging with luxury items .... What a contrast to His coming. A stable. Poverty. Lowliness. What obscurity. No one there but a few paltry shepherds, and later a few wise men came. That’s all.

![Kings headline](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Why-Study/kings-headline.jpg?sfvrsn=327a1d16_0 "Kings headline")
The nation of Israel rises and shines during King Solomon’s Golden Age and then plummets through 400 years of mostly evil kings who eventually manage to get the Jewish nation wiped off the map. What remains? A faithful God, true to His promise to redeem His people.

When Elijah looked at that little brook which was getting smaller and smaller he learned a spiritual lesson. He saw that he was nothing—he was just a brook, a channel, through which living water could flow.

There are times in our lives when the circumstances will not produce any joy or happiness. There are times when we find ourselves in dark places, like David. We look about, and the situation looks hopeless. What should we do?
