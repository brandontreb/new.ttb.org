***And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.*** -Acts 24:24, 25


This couple of rascals probably would never have attended a church in which the gospel was preached, nor would they have gone to hear Paul the apostle if he had come to town to preach. Yet here these two have this great opportunity given to them under the most favorable circumstances. They have a private interview with the greatest preacher of the grace of God that the world has ever known. Oh, the wonder of the grace of God to give these two a chance! The hour of salvation struck for them. The door of the kingdom was opened, and they had their opportunity to enter. 


It appears that they heard Paul with a great deal of interest. I think Felix would have liked to have made a decision for Christ, but he didn’t make that decision. He wanted to wait for a convenient season. **My friend, the sinner will never have a convenient season to hear the gospel. Man does not set the time; God does.**


It has been proven out in the history of the human family that folk can keep postponing making a decision for Christ until they come to the place where they cannot make a decision for Him at all. That is the reason that most decisions for Christ are made by young people. Also this is the reason a person need not think that because he is getting older he is becoming smarter. Older people just become more hardened to the gospel. “Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee,” said Felix. That time never came for him. That time does not come for a great many people who postpone receiving Christ.


--Dr. J. Vernon McGee, from *Edited Messages on Acts*
