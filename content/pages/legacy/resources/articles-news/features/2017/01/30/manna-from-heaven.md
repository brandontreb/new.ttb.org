 Manna from Heaven

The children of Israel left Mount Sinai and marched to Kadesh. When problems arose, the people fell to murmuring. “And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp” (Numbers 11:1). Every time the people complained, the glory of the Lord appeared. He was displeased with their groaning and complaining.  

  

We can be sure that the Lord is displeased with many of the criticizing, complaining saints today. They are everlastingly finding fault and nothing seems to please them. God doesn’t want it that way for you, my friend. He wants you to be a happy, joyful Christian.  

  

Out there in the wilderness, what do you think they wanted? “We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely…but now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes” (Numbers 11:5, 6). They couldn’t catch fish out in that wilderness—there weren’t any lakes. I’m of the opinion that in Egypt they were tired of the fish, but now that is what they remembered.  

  

So they start to complain about the manna. It is miraculously provided by God every day, but they don’t like it. It was God’s food; it gave them complete nourishment. Manna, of course, is a picture of the Lord Jesus and the Word of God which reveals Him.  

  

Let’s not sit back and say how terrible the children of Israel were. How about you, my friend? That manna speaks of Christ. How do you feel about Him? Do you get tired of Him? Many Christians get tired of manna. A lot of people get tired of Bible study. I think it is safe to say that the largest segment of the church today does not want Bible study. The predicament of the church today is due to the fact that folk have turned from the Word and are trying to feed somewhere else other than on the manna which God has provided.
