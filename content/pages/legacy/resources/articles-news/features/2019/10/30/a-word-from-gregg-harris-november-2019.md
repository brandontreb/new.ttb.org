 A Word from Gregg Harris | November 2019

## Gregg's letter Nov 2019


## And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.


Certain promises in Scripture are understated in their wording yet stagger us in their meaning. Philippians 4:19 is one of them. This simple sentence presents a revolutionary truth. The context discusses monetary needs, and so our first application is to be confident God will take care of us and we’re not to worry about having enough. He’s our Father, ready to provide everything each child needs. And His willingness to provide matches His ability to do so. 


Your generosity in providing for the needs *Thru the Bible* faces in sharing the whole Word to the whole world demonstrates you believe that. You pray and give and engage with this mission because you believe God is at work. You can give these things because you’re confident your heavenly Father will provide for you, especially as you support that which brings Him glory. 


Something else that feels understated yet means so much?  Our words of gratitude for your partnership. 


Believe Philippians 4:19 today. 


 Grateful,
