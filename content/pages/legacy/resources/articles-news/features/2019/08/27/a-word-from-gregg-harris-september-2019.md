## elderly womanThe beauty of God's Word is that God uses it where you are.


Come hungry; God will fill you.  

Come with questions; God’s Spirit will direct.  

Come heartbroken; He will restore.  

The point is—just come. 


The beauty of the Bible Bus is that whether you ride every day or hop on and off, you’ll find something in the study of God’s Word every time. It won’t be a coincidence (as our brother from Mexico mentioned on page 12). God uses His Word to reach the seeking heart. Sometimes it’s just a phrase or a paragraph or an illustration that lets light in. It might take a lifetime to understand the depths, but seeing it happens in an instant—right where you are. 


As you pray this month for *Thru the Bible*, ask the Lord for more of these moments, in more people’s hearts, all across the globe. God bless you today as you seek Him in His Word. 


 Grateful for your partnership,
