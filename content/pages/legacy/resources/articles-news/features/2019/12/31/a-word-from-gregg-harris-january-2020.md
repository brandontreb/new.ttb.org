 A Word from Gregg Harris | January 2020


December 31, 2019
![Jan 2020 Gregg letter](https://ttb.org/images/default-source/Features-and-News/jan-2020-gregg-letter.jpg?sfvrsn=5c8d1e16_0 "Jan 2020 Gregg letter")




If anyone asked us why *Thru the Bible* is so focused on “taking the whole Word to the whole Word,” most of us would say, **because Jesus told us to.** 


And that’s true. The last thing Jesus said before His feet lifted off the Mount of Olives and returned to heaven in Matthew 28 was, *Go make disciples of all the nations . . . teach them.* And so that is what we are doing in partnership each month. *Thru the Bible* does not do this alone. As you pray and support this ministry effort, we do it together.


But that’s just part of the story. 


Do you also realize that God has had the nations in mind for generations? God is reversing what He did back at the Tower of Babel. He confused and separated people by introducing languages—and now He’s bringing people back together again by bringing the gospel to them in their own languages, especially the language that speaks to each individual heart. 


**Because everywhere the gospel goes, people will call on the name of the Lord.** 


This is the mission you and I get to be part of when we take the whole Word to the whole world. We get to witness people hearing the Good News of Jesus Christ and running to Him. 


We do this together, in the power of God’s Spirit carrying the truth of God’s Word. And here’s even better news—Jesus told us in Matthew 28, *“And lo, I am**with you always, even to the end of the age.”* *Amen.*


Let’s remember this amazing mission and do what He says every day of the new year. And be encouraged—He promises to be with us.


Grateful for your investment,
