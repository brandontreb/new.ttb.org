### What is one essential the godly man and woman need to successfully navigate this life? Dr. McGee shared that it’s a prescription only God can fill. And you’ve probably got one within arm’s reach.


***All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.*** -2 Timothy 3:16


Allow me to make a correction to this translation. It’s not *all* Scripture but *every* Scripture. Every one of these words are God’s words to you and me, and they contain the prescription for living successfully for God today. There’s no other place to get the remedy except in God’s Word.


Like with most medicines, you’re not done after just one dose. A man once approached evangelist Dwight L. Moody and said, “I hope to get enough religion out of your meetings to last me the rest of my life.” Moody responded, “Did you eat enough breakfast this morning to last you the rest of your life?” 


My friend, the Word of God contains the medicine you and I need to live in these hard days, but we must take *all* of it. The trouble today is that folks try to take just a part of the prescription. They read a daily devotion or a few verses and think they’re taking God’s medicine. My beloved, *you’ve got to get into the book*. You don’t get the answer with memorizing ten or even 150 verses. You need all of it.


Paul says, “*You must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them”* (2 Timothy 3:14). We need salvation today and tomorrow and the day after that. The word “continue” here can mean “to be always at home.” It’s the same word our Lord used when He said, *“In My Father’s house are many mansions”* (John 14:2)—abiding places. 


Christian, do you live in the book? How much do you really read and study it?


The man and woman of God can never complete their journey without this one thing. We need hope that tomorrow will be brighter. We need hope that at the end of this journey there is satisfaction and fullness of life. We get it, friend, right here in God’s Word: *“For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope”* (Jeremiah 29:11). 


Have confidence in the Bible, my beloved, and you will find in it all you need to face the hardships of life.

## My Turn



Life is a journey for a Christian—a relationship with Jesus and inviting His Word to provide what we need. Look up the following verses from God’s Word and reflect on what you’ve packed for the journey when you take His Word to heart. Dr. McGee mentions these in his booklet “What to Do When Life is Hard”:


* A roadmap—Psalm 119:105
* A light—Psalm 119:30
* Bread to eat—Luke 4:4
* Water—Isaiah 55:10
* A way to keep clean—John 15:3
* Protection/defense—Ephesians 6:17
* A first-aid kit—Psalm 147:3
* Companionship—Psalm 119:165; Hebrews 13:5
* Hope that tomorrow will be brighter, that at the end of the journey you’ll find satisfaction and fullness of life—1 Peter 3:15


Which of the (above) packing supplies are you grateful to God for today? Circle them. Then, star one or two more you’d like to specifically pray God will provide for you in this season.
