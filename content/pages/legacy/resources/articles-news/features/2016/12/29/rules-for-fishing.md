 Rules for Fishing

 Luke 5 tells of a time when the Lord Jesus climbed into Simon Peter’s boat and asked him to push it out a little from the land. What a pulpit! Every pulpit is a “fishing boat,” a place to give out the Word of God and attempt to catch fish. Jesus told His disciples that He would make them fishers of men. This does not mean that you and I will catch fish every time we give out the Word—the disciples didn’t—but it does mean that the one on board must not forget the supreme business of life, which is to fish for the souls of men.  

  

After the Lord had finished speaking to the people, He said, “Now we’ll leave off fishing for men, and we’re going to fish for fish.” He told Simon, “Launch out into the deep and let your net down. You quit fishing with Me; now I am going to fish with you.”  

  

***And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.***   -Luke 5:5, 6  

  

There are many lessons for us here. Fishing is an art: You must go where the fish are; you must use the right kind of bait; you must be patient; but the most important lesson He is teaching us is that we must fish according to His instructions. If we are ever going to win men for Him, we must fish according to His instructions.
