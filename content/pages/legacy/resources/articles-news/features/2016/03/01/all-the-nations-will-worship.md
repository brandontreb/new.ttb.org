 All the Nations Will Worship

***Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.*** - Revelation 15:4


The book of Revelation is Christ-centered. Don’t let the four horsemen carry you away or be distracted by the blowing of the trumpets or by the seven performers. And don’t let your interest center on these bowls of wrath. Let’s keep our eyes centered on Christ. He is in charge; He is the Lord. In this book we have the unveiling of Jesus Christ in His holiness, in His power, and in His glory. The Man Christ Jesus is wonderful! He is the One who can put His hand in the hand of God and who can put His other hand in the hand of man and bring them together. He can do this because He is God.


**“King of the ages”** has two other renderings: *King of saints* and *King of the nations*. Any rendering indicates that Christ will be the object of universal worship and acknowledgment. There will be no place where He will not be worshiped.


**“Nations shall come and worship before thee.”** This is not true of nations today. We are not living in a Christian nation, but there will come a day when every nation will worship Him. This knowledge should cause us to take heart. The day will come when God will remove the rebellious men and leave only those who will worship Him.


In Psalm 2:8 we read, *“Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen [nations] for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.”* The nations are going to be His. And in Isaiah 11:9: *“They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”* In that day there will be no need for our *Thru the Bible* study because all men are going to have a knowledge of God. In Jeremiah 23:5 we are told, *“Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.”*


In Philippians 2:9-11 we read this: *“Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”* Those who are in hell will not acknowledge Him as their Redeemer, but they are going to acknowledge that He is the boss, He is running the universe, and it belongs to Him. And they are going to acknowledge the glory of God—they will *have* to do that.


- Dr. J. Vernon McGee, from *Edited Messages on Revelation*
