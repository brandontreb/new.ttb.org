 A Word from Gregg Harris | November 2022

## Hey, Look at These!

Recently THRU the BIBLE was given a gift—thousands and thousands of photographic slides taken by Dr. McGee in the 1970’s. Who knew he was such a shutterbug? The slides are from missions trips and THRU the BIBLE trips to visit radio producers in South America, Africa, and Europe and road trips that he and Mrs. McGee took around America. Word has it that everywhere he went, Dr. McGee had a camera around his neck—and we have the slides to prove it. 

One carousel of slides (if you were born before 1970, you know what I mean) captured all the early operations of THRU the BIBLE. He took pictures of people opening mail, working with reel to reel tape, crating up programs to ship to stations. He shot happy people chatting in the parking lot, leaning on vintage cars. 

The whole delightful trip down memory lane reminded me of the instruction Paul gave to young pastor, Timothy: “And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also” (2 Timothy 2:2). When Paul wrote this letter, two generations had passed since Jesus walked among them. Paul said in essence, *Keep it going.* *Keep the gospel moving to the ends of the earth just as Jesus instructed.* 

Dr. McGee stepped into God’s presence December 1, 1988—34 years ago next month. Because of partners like you, today we’re still taking his teaching and the Word of God to the whole world—farther and deeper than ever. We’ve been entrusted with this treasure—and we’re going to keep it moving to the ends of the earth from our generation to the next. That’s the mission you’re a part of.

 

## Thanks for your partnership in this grand work of God,
