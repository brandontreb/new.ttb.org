 A Word from Gregg Harris | August 2022

## The Gospel Chain

I have always been interested in hearing how people come to faith in Jesus Christ. 

You’ve heard me tell of how my older sister, Kathi, led me to Christ when I was a pre-teen. In college, I got involved in a wonderful campus ministry that helped grow me up in the faith. As a young man, I first heard Dr. McGee on the radio of my VW bug, and I was introduced to global ministry. 

What’s your chain of faith? Who first introduced you to Jesus? Who is God using to grow you up in your faith? Who is giving you a vision for your life as it relates to sharing the gospel with others? Who are you building into, as someone once built into you? 

If your faith chain is rich with relationships and connections, praise God for that and keep going. If your faith chain doesn’t yet include a lot of people—what a great day to start. God is using your life and your experiences and relationship to be a strong first link in others’ chains. (omit this paragraph if copy is too long)

As a vital member of the THRU the BIBLE listening family, a wonderful family of faith, you are part of this Albanian shepherd boy’s chain of faith. He shares: “My brother first gave me a solar radio 13 years ago to listen to when I go out with the sheep. I had not heard about God yet, but my first program was *Thru the Bible*. After listening a while, I called the radio station, who then invited me to their church, where my family and I now go. Your radio program helped me know God personally. Thank you very much.”

I echo his heart—*thank you so very much*. Your partnership in taking God’s whole Word to the whole world is forming long and strong links in the gospel chain. 

I thank God for you!

 

## Grateful for your partnership,
