 Greetings from the Bible Bus | August 2022

**“I grew up in a home where no one went to church and no one talked about Jesus. After I grew up, married, and had children of my own, I felt that Jesus was trying to reach me.** So, I turned on my radio and started listening to preachers. I became even more confused as they all seemed to be teaching different beliefs. Then one day I found Dr. McGee and I loved his voice, so I kept listening. He made sense and I could follow his teaching. **Long story short, I surrendered my life to Christ Jesus and from then on, one by one, my whole family did the same.** I still listen to Dr. McGee every day and I always seem to learn something new. Keep the Bible Bus traveling to the hungry souls out there.” 

-From Juanita in Florida

**“Several years ago, I was about as far away from God as you can get.** In fact, the thought of God never even entered my mind. Well, as you could guess, I made a mess of my life. One night, driving across Kansas on I-70 with nothing but corn fields on my right and left and in the quiet, **I sensed God asking for my attention—that’s the only way I can describe it. To get away from that new—and awkward—feeling, I turned on the radio. The reception was bad on every station except one—a Christian radio station** (go figure!). It was then I first heard that horrible southern drawl and quirky speech talk about our relationship with God. *No way*, I thought. *I’m not listening to that voice*. So, I went back to silence. A few minutes later, I turned it back on. **Long story short, that horrible drawl was the first to introduce me to the thought that God loved me, and that Jesus died for me. A few days later, through other circumstances, I surrendered my life to Jesus, my Savior.** By the way, I’ve been on the Bible Bus ever since that Kansas night, 11 years ago. **Praise God for Dr. McGee and for that southern drawl. It’s the voice of an old friend now, and I love it more every day.”** 

-From an unnamed friend on the Bible Bus
