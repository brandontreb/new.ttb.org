 A Word from Gregg Harris | March 2022

## Any Way Possible

* Terrestrial radio
* Digital radio
* Television
* YouTube.com
* Speaker boxes
* MP3 players
* Apps
* Alexa, Roku
* Carrier pigeon

Yes, whatever it takes, that’s what we’ll do. We’re so committed to getting God’s whole Word to the whole world that we’re exploring the most out-there option (OK, maybe not carrier pigeons), which just might be the answer to reaching someone unreachable any other way.  

We know one delivery method that never fails. James 5:16 says “the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective” (NIV).  

Partner with us in prayer that God’s Word and THRU the BIBLE will go places this month we never dreamed possible.    


Go ahead—pray right now. God is listening, and He’s proven over and again that He answers. 

 

### Grateful for your partnership,

Gregg Harris  
THRU the BIBLE, president
