 A Word from Gregg Harris | October 2022

## *“How could a book be alive? It was written centuries ago ….”*

That’s how the recent letter we received from Alyson started out. Then her story changed—

*“That’s what I thought when I first picked up the Bible on the dare of a friend. She dared me to read the Gospel of John—any portion—for 30 days in a row. She said, ‘the Bible is alive—just give it a chance.’ A couple weeks into the dare I discovered your program. Then, not only did I read the Gospel of John, I listened to Dr. McGee explain it. Well, I won the dare. I read John for 30 days, and yesterday I asked Jesus to be my Savior—to forgive my sins, to give me everlasting life with Him. I look forward to learning more about the Bible in time to come.”*

Wow. Did you know that the Gospel of John was written for this exact purpose? John 20:31 says, “But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.” Alyson’s friend was so wise to dare her to read John. 

God’s Word is alive and powerful. That’s why we’re working together to get it to everyone on the planet who will listen. Across cultures, across languages, the Bible speaks to our hearts regarding our own issues. It’s happening today.   


 

## Your partner in taking the whole Word to the whole world,
