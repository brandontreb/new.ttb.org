 A Word from Gregg Harris | May 2022

## Numbers

I’m a numbers guy. I hear an idea or a proposal and already I’m doing the math in my head. It’s fun. But the pluses and minuses are not the whole picture. Dr. McGee knew that and so, from day one, THRU the BIBLE hasn’t been tied to numbers as the primary way decisions are made. That’s why you don’t often hear us talk about the number of people impacted in a country or even more basic, the numbers needed to do specific projects, etc. **Dr. McGee called it “the sin of statistics” and warned against putting confidence in numbers rather than in the Lord.** 

Yes, of course, we are fully aware of financial matters, feeling the weight of stewarding well the resources God entrusts to THRU the BIBLE, but we just don’t trust numbers to paint the whole picture. **For that, we rely on two indicators:** 

### Your stories and testimonies about how God is at work in your life.

### Your partnership in prayer and support.

**These two indicators influence our decisions more than algorithms or views, likes, or shares.** 

The truth is, we can’t know how far our impact goes and whether it changes anything for anyone on the receiving end. **We must trust God to be faithful to His promise that His Word will accomplish what He intends it to do** (Isaiah 55:11). 

That’s a very safe investment, don’t you think? 

### Grateful for your partnership,

Gregg Harris  
THRU the BIBLE, president
