 Jesus in Deuteronomy

## If we could ask Jesus what His favorite book of the Old Testament was, it’s likely He would name Deuteronomy as one of His top three.

He quoted Deuteronomy at critical times—specifically in the wilderness when He was resisting Satan’s temptations. He also quoted Deuteronomy when He summed up the Law and the prophets and taught us to love God and love our neighbor as ourselves. And when He quoted the ten commandments, when discussing divorce, when telling us that we are to live by the Word of God, and to keep His Word.

**If you remember, Deuteronomy was Moses’ swan song—his final lecture to a new generation about to enter the Promised Land.** Moses spoke of a deliverer that was to come in the future. Moses had played the mediator between God and them for 40 years, but he prophesied of another mediator, a perfect Prophet, still to come. **He called people to listen to this new mediator; and just as they learned to listen to him, Moses called them to listen to this final messenger, the Lord Jesus Christ.**

### “I will raise up for them a Prophet like you from among their brethren, and will put My words in His mouth, and He shall speak to them all that I command Him.” -Deuteronomy 18:18

**Now some ask why God doesn’t reveal Himself today.** 

My friend, in the person of Jesus Christ, God put the period at the end of the sentence. God wrote *finis* at the end of the book. God hasn’t any more to say to this world than He’s said in Jesus Christ! And we’re to listen to Him. He has the final Word! The Lord Jesus Christ is God’s ultimate, God’s full, and God’s final revelation for man. 

**During the Lord Jesus’ time on earth, He did His Father’s will—and He finished all of His assignments,** *I said everything that You wanted Me to say; I’ve said it all!* If God spoke out of heaven at this very moment, He wouldn’t say anything that He had not already said. He’d just repeat Himself, because He said all He intends to say to you and me in the person of Christ.
