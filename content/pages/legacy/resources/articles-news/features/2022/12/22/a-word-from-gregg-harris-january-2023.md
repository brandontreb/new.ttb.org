 A Word from Gregg Harris | January 2023

## First Things First

First things belong to God. We see that principle throughout the Bible. 

The first fruit of the harvest belongs to God. The first day of the week belongs to God. The first of our income belongs to God. Some would say the first minutes of the day belong to Him. 

Well, here we stand in the first weeks, days, and hours of a new year, and it is good for us to offer them to the Lord as we begin 2023. What will He do in and through us this year? My prayer is that He will do a lot. My hope is that when we meet here again in 2024 we would be different, and millions around the world will be different because of our choice to prioritize His Word in our lives and also in our mission to take His Word to the whole world. 

Let’s invite Jesus Christ to take first place in our lives this year. To make Him our utmost priority. Thank you for your commitment and support in taking God’s whole Word to the whole world in 2023. That’s a mission we can be about every day of the new year and on into eternity. 

***So that He Himself will come to have first place in everything.*** -Colossians 1:18 (NASB) 

 

## Grateful for you,

THRU the BIBLE, president
