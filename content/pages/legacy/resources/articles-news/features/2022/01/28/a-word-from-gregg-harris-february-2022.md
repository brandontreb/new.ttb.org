 A Word from Gregg Harris | February 2022

## Blessed to Be a Blessing

When God made His covenant with Abraham, He said,*I will bless you … so that you will be a blessing* (see Genesis 12:2).

The principle certainly follows for us, too. As God blesses us, we want to bless others. 

You do that every day when you pray for others to hear and receive God’s Word taught on THRU the BIBLE and when you give joyfully to make that happen. Thank you sincerely.

I thought today you would be blessed by a living example of this. I pulled this note from the report on pages 6-7. Matthew, who rides the Bible Bus in Uganda says, “I listen every day to *Thru the Bible*. I’m writing to thank you for the work you do for God. Your program has helped me to go deep in knowing Him. It is changing my heart and soul. When I listen to God’s Word, it always encourages me to reach out and share it with others, too.” 

It’s a beautiful full circle—as we are blessed, we want to be a blessing to others. 

Thank you for your example of this generosity this month. Together we joyfully take God’s whole Word to the whole world.  

### Grateful for your partnership,

THRU the BIBLE, president
