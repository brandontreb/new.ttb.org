 A Word from Gregg Harris | April 2022

## The Best Day of the Year

Dr. McGee calls it “the best day of the year.”  

We celebrate Jesus Christ’s resurrection from the dead this month, the most pivotal event in history and, yes, in our lives. Recently I was reminded of this glorious day when we got this letter from Manuel in Tucson, Arizona:  

Nobody else in history ever died, laid for days in a tomb, then got up, appeared to hundreds, and left the earth, never to die again. If there was nothing else to the story of Jesus Christ, then this alone would change everything. But the other day I was listening to Dr. McGee’s study in Galatians and what I learned changed everything for me for the rest of my life. 

Galatians 2:20: “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.”

Thank you, *Thru the Bible*, for planting this reality into my life. Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross was made for love and it was made for life. I live today and for eternity with Him because I died with Christ and now live in Him by faith. I don’t know exactly all that this means but will find out in heaven. 

Thanks, Manuel, for reminding us of resurrection truth that is so beautiful and deep that it will take a lifetime to unpack. No wonder we all stay on the Bible Bus for multiple trips!  

Let’s celebrate today what Jesus Christ’s resurrection means to us every single day of the year. Thank you for your partnership in “taking the whole Word of God to the whole world.” God’s Word changes everything!

### Grateful for your partnership,
