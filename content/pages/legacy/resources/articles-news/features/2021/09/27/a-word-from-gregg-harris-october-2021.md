 A Word from Gregg Harris | October 2021

## It’s a mystery.

 People like you who have been impacted by the teaching of God’s Word on THRU the BIBLE often ask, *How can I most effectively be involved in taking the whole Word to the whole world?*

That’s the kind of question I love to answer. But the answer may surprise you. 

The best way we can link arms and be part of what God is doing in our generation is to pray for God’s will to be done through us. *Wait.* *Not tell others? Not financially support?* Albeit, those are great secondary ways to come alongside; but the primary way for you to make a difference is to pray. 

Yes, I know—it’s a mystery. James 5:16 says the prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.

Would you pray right now for the effective impact of THRU the BIBLE as people listen to it today? Thank the Lord that nothing will hinder God’s purpose from being accomplished. Ask Him for many lives to be changed today through the power of His Word. Beginning with ours. 

 

### Grateful for your partnership in the gospel,

Gregg Harris  
THRU the BIBLE, president
