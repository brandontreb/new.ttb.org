 A Word from Gregg Harris | July 2021

## We're Celebrating a Thanksgiving in July

Every time we receive one of your emails, letters, voicemails, videos, etc., I am reminded that God promises to grow a harvest where we plant a seed. He is the Lord of the harvest, working in His own appointed time. 

We are not farmers, but we are each called to work a field. We share God’s Word as far and wide as we can, to the best of our ability, always understanding that God is the one who causes a seed to come to life with the water of His Word. He brings the growth and multiplies our work. As the apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3:6, we plant but God brings the increase. 

That’s why Dr. McGee repeatedly said we’re called to sow, not to harvest. Our God-given assignments are to pray, to give, to share, to communicate. Our role in this harvest is to faithfully and with faith sow the seed farther. We obey God, and He is the one who multiplies. 

Over the last five decades, THRU the BIBLE has operated under the mandate to carefully steward God’s blessing and, in turn, bless others with it. Together we take His whole Word to the whole world in partnership, just as God designed ministry to be done. Each time you hear stories of how God is working in people’s lives, think of a bountiful harvest, a feast of blessings!

 

### We wish you a very happy thanksgiving,

THRU the BIBLE, president
