## What is God Teaching You?

We often ask that at the end of the daily program. The letters and emails you send from all over the world testify to the transforming power of God's Word. The Spirit of God Himself makes the Word of God real to our hearts. We know this to be true. 

I read a letter today from a fellow Bible Bus rider named Llewellyn who testifies to this fact and encourages me. I think he will encourage you, too: 

*“**The prayer team is an important part of the ministry because it puts on display our dependence on God and expresses our desire to be in alignment with His will. When we unite in fervent prayer to God, the load becomes so much lighter and stress and anxiety is illuminated; we rest in the faithfulness of God, and He intervenes and directs our paths. Prayer is our highway to God, and it’s never closed. He expects and waits for our prayers. The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayer…. Let’s pray with wisdom, let’s pray with thanksgiving, let’s pray without ceasing.”*

I count it one of my greatest privileges to pray with you and for you today. ### Grateful for your partnership,

THRU the BIBLE, president
