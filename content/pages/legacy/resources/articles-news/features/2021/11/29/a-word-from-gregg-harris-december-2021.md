 A Word from Gregg Harris | December 2021

## Follow God's lead ...

One of the great privileges of leading the ministry of THRU the BIBLE is watching God move in the most wonderful and extraordinary ways.   


We often tell you of our passionate commitment to follow God’s leading, rather than our own ideas. Not only is this conviction rooted in Scripture, it’s the best way to live our lives in Christ.  

The prophet Isaiah affirmed,  

***“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,” says the Lord. “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.”*** -Isaiah 55:8-9 

Time and again, we experience the wonder of following God’s ways. When we do, we see that He always has great things in store for us--better than we could ever design for ourselves.   

I trust that you, too, are finding this true in your life as you walk in step with the Lord. Certainly as a valued partner in taking the whole Word to the whole world, you can watch in wonder how each month He’s doing something new. And He’s using our partnership to get it done.  

What a privilege. And what an honor to share this mission with you. 

### Grateful,

THRU the BIBLE, president
