## Who introduced you to THRU the BIBLE?

Almost every day, we hear about how a mom or dad or a grandparent or an uncle first helped someone board the Bible Bus. 

Even on our tiny staff, one team member just told me her grandfather took classes with Dr. McGee at Biola University back in the 1950’s. And today she and her grandmother listen together and discuss what they learned. And in the 1970’s, another staff member said at an elementary school age she was made to sit on the couch and listen to Dr. McGee until she heard, “May God richly bless you, my beloved.” What a heritage! 

Faithful generations pass the torch to faithful generations that follow them. We hear about this all the time. Like this summer when we got this email from James: 

### “This Saturday, my wife and I welcomed into the world our first child (baby boy Noah). We were released from the hospital last night and this morning he became a third generation Bus rider!

### “To borrow from Jacob in Genesis 48: *The God before whom my fathers walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, the angel who has redeemed me from all evil: bless the lad.*

### “Thank you for continuing Dr. McGee’s broadcasts, and may this ministry continue to bless many more generations to come.”

Did a loved one from a previous generation introduce you to the Bible Bus? Send us a picture and your story! 

 

### Grateful for the faithful of every generation,
