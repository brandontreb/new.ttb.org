 A Word from Gregg Harris | August 2021

## Did you have a garage sale yet?

Thatâ€™s what summertime is for â€¦ garage sales. ðŸ˜Š Out with the old, make room for the new. 

The older I get, the clearer it is to me that we donâ€™t take any stuff out of this life. The temporal-ness of our possessions only serves to remind us of all we have to look forward to in the permanent joy and eternal presence with God. 

I encourage you to let this truth sink in today. Let it set you free from the pointless pursuit of seeking your joy and security in gaining more stuff. Instead, learn the joy of contentment with what you have, and the freedom that gives. 

Thanks for your partnership with THRU the BIBLE and the investment of your gifts of prayer and support. As you give freely and sacrificially from what God has entrusted you with, you are investing in what He is doing in our generation. You are getting your heart ready for eternity. 

Â 

### Looking forward to that day,

Gregg Harris  
THRU the BIBLE, president
