## Until We're All Home

This month marks the end of our 5-year journey through the whole Word of God—our 10th trip. This April, we’ll begin the 11th trip. Many of you have been on several of these complete tours—and some have been on all 10. (We’d love to hear from you, by the way! [Tell us all about your journeys](/about/contact-us).)  

As we finish up our time in the book of Revelation, our studies grow very solemn. A tragedy is coming … not for us who know Jesus as our Savior, but for a world that rejects Him. There will be no escape from the judgments that will descend on the earth. As sorrowful as it should make us feel, Dr. McGee tells us it should do more than that—“It not only ought to affect our *hearts*, it ought also to affect our *wills* and our *feet* to start us moving to get the Word of God out to the world. That is our solemn responsibility.”  

We do consider it our solemn responsibility to get out the Word of God while we can. I know you feel the same way. We thank God for your partnership in prayer and for the privilege we have of watching Him work in hearts around the globe. We’re going to do this together for as long as we can. 

Because we’re not home yet. 

Until then, the Bible Bus will continue our journey through the peaks and valleys of the whole Word of God. We’ll call out to whoever will listen and encourage each other on with God. In so doing, we testify to God’s power in and through our lives and walk each other home, safely into the arms of Jesus at journey’s end. 

*You are a chosen people … God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light*. -1 Peter 2:9 (NIV)

### Grateful for your partnership in the gospel,

Gregg Harris  
THRU the BIBLE, president 

### \*We’ve got your seat saved on the Bible Bus. See you in the [new journey](/resources/study-guides/guidelines-study-guide), beginning April 2.
