## A Heart Filled with Gratitude

My heart is full today with thanksgiving for all you who stand with THRU the BIBLE in partnership. Together we are taking the whole Word to the whole world.  

Now I understand that when you first got on the Bible Bus, you were hoping to find good Bible teaching that would open up God’s Word to you. And I trust you’ve found that.  

But, oh, there’s so much more to our journey on the Bible Bus. (For just a taste of the excitement, delight in what God has done most recently [in the Muslim world](/resources/articles-news/news/2021/12/23/celebrating-new-ministry-to-the-muslim-world).)  

THRU the BIBLE is so much more than receiving God’s Word—it’s also sharing it with everyone who will listen. It’s a full circle.  

So, if you’re in this glorious circle—praying and investing in sharing God’s Word—then I bless you in Jesus’ name today.  

And if you’re not yet in partnership—*what are you waiting for?* God is doing amazing things, and He welcomes us to play a part. 

 

### Grateful,

THRU the BIBLE, president
