## In an unprecedented year of challenges, your investment in THRU the BIBLE made it possible for God’s Word to travel unhindered through your hometowns, near and far.

As THRU the BIBLE’s president, Gregg Harris, [shared](/resources/articles-news/features/2021/05/29/a-biblical-philosophy-of-ministry), “more than 3,000 over-the-air broadcasts [go out] each day, or 125 each hour, or about two broadcasts every minute.” And that’s not even counting the times someone was challenged or encouraged from God’s Word via an app, podcasting, online, through ministry partners like OnePlace.com, YouVersion, or on YouTube.  

### Thank you for your faithful investment of prayer and finances to take the whole Word to the whole world.
