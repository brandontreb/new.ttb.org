 Jesus in 1 Corinthians

## In Corinth, as well as in most cities of that day, human philosophy reigned supreme. The apostle Paul knew that firsthand. But the gospel challenged that focus on human achievement and offered so much more—changed lives.

### 

While he was in Corinth, Paul preached the Cross of Christ. But the Corinthian Jews rejected it, which just made him turn his focus to the Gentiles (Acts 18:6) and to anyone who would listen. And many people not only heard the invitation, they also responded in faith. **They found in the Cross of Christ the wisdom and power of God to change their lives, answer their deepest emotional questions, and give them a brand-new beginning in life** (1 Corinthians 1:24-26; 2 Corinthians 5:17).

### Some people enjoy aligning themselves with famous believers—the entertainment greats, leaders in industry, and the prominent in government. But God majors in average people like you. He calls simple people like all of us to know Him through a relationship with His Son Jesus Christ.

Does that mean you are foolish to believe in Jesus? No! You may appear weak to your unbelieving family but take heart: This is God’s gracious way. That’s why none of us have anything to brag about when it comes to our salvation. Jesus gets all the credit.

And He is everything we need. This is what God longs to communicate to you and to everyone who seeks Him. He is your wisdom. He is your righteousness. He is your sanctification and your redemption. **Whatever it is that you need today, you will find it in Him.**

Our glory should be in the Lord. We should make Jesus Christ famous every day by how our lives honor Him. What are you boasting about today? In your degrees? In your wisdom? In your financial portfolio? In your children? Do you boast today about your position of influence? That’s all emptiness until you find your glory in Jesus. 

## We can boast of Christ; He is everything we need.
