 A Word from Gregg Harris | March 2023

## You Smell Like … Life!

 

At its core, the Bible’s message is about the cross of Jesus Christ. Dr. McGee explains this in [his piece this month](/resources/articles-news/features/2023/02/27/what-does-the-cross-mean-to-you), and it’s the message we hope to preach every day on THRU the BIBLE. 

And given that message, people will hear about the cross and be divided into two camps. They will say: 1) “That’s foolishness” or 2) “That’s life.” To some we smell like the fragrance of life and to others we smell like death—see 2 Corinthians 2:14-17. 

I love what verse 16 essentially asks, *So, are you up to this task?* And we can say, *Certainly not*. Good thing it’s God who takes His Word to the world, and we just do our best to do what He asks. We get what we say straight from Him and say it as honestly as we can. 

As 2 Corinthians 2 goes on, we don’t peddle the Word of God; but sincerely, “as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ” (v. 17). We stand before God in how we do this.

This is the mission you’ve signed up for when you partner with us in taking the whole Word to the whole world. Let’s stand together. 

 

## Grateful for your partnership,

THRU the BIBLE, president
