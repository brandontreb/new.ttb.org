 A Word from Gregg Harris | February 2023

## He Loved Us First

In keeping with a common theme in February, let me write a love letter to you, my co-laborers in the faith. 

As we study 1 Corinthians on the Bible Bus, I’ve often been reminded of how God equips ordinary people with spiritual gifts to accomplish His work in the world. That’s you and me!  

Dr. McGee said he was glad God is still calling ordinary folks to Himself. We haven’t anything to glory about outside of Christ. But God promises to be for us our wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption (see 1 Corinthians 1). “Whatever you need today,” Dr. McGee said, “you can find it in Jesus.” And whatever the ministry of THRU the BIBLE needs, we’ll find in Him, as well. We have a long history to prove God’s faithfulness is true. 

We love Him because He first loved us, and nothing is going to separate us from that. Our story in God is a love story, and it keeps getting better and better. 

Here’s to another chapter together this month. I’m grateful for the privilege of sharing the mission with you of taking God’s whole Word to the whole word. 

Let’s keep writing the story.  

## Gratefully,
