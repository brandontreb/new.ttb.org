 A Word from Gregg Harris | April 2023

## Do You Have the Time?

Today, we will each be given 24 hours to spend as we want. We can invest it or waste it or enjoy it. The time we spend in God’s Word and in prayer—well, it just couldn’t be spent any better. When you invest your time with God, you’re making a statement about what you consider important. 

In Psalm 90:12, Moses asks God to teach us how to number our days that we may present to Him a heart of wisdom. This kind of “numbering our days” describes a concept of time the Greeks called *kairos*. 

Kairos time doesn’t refer to the clock or calendar time (that’s a different Greek word, *chronos*), but to a unique opportunity within time for something significant. It signifies a strategic or pivotal moment, a one-time, a passing opportunity. The Bible often exhorts us to take advantage of the time God has given us for both *chronos* and *kairos*. 

At THRU the BIBLE, we’re thinking all the time of how to make the Bible and Dr. McGee’s instruction all the more accessible to you, to allow you to make the most of the strategic moments of the day when God might just want to say something to you through His Word. 

I commend you for making time in God’s Word a priority in your *chronos* time so that you can catch those *kairos* moments as a gift from God. That’s my prayer for us all. 

 

## Grateful for your partnership in the gospel,
