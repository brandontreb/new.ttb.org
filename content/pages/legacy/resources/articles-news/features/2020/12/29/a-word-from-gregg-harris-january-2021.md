## “May God richly bless you, my beloved.”

For decades, we’ve heard Dr. McGee end nearly every daily study with these words. He really loved teaching you God’s Word and wanted you to be blessed by it. He called you, *Beloved.* Whata great word.  

Many New Testament writers addressed their letters to “beloved” people (for example, Philippians 4:1; 2 Corinthians 7:1; 1 Peter 2:11). Most of the time, the Greek word translated as “beloved” is *agapētoi* and is related to the word *agape*.  

*Beloved* means “friends very loved by God.” But in the New Testament, the word means even more than human affection. It tells of an esteem we hold for others that comes from recognizing their value as children of God. Those called *beloved* are more than friends; they are brothers and sisters in Christ. You are highly valued and loved. 

Remember that from now on when you hear Dr. McGee say those closing words.  

### God bless you, my beloved,
