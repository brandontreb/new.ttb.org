## “Joy to the world … the Lord has come!”

Each time you sing that carol this season, I want you to be reminded of something important. Together, in the message and ministry of *Thru the Bible,* we’re bringing that eternal kind of “joy to the world” through the name ofthe Lord Jesus Christ. Countless people are listening—worldwide … and down the street from you. 

2020 will be remembered as the year the world went into lockdown. As governments restricted people from moving freely within their localities and around the world, something else was happening. “But the word of God is not chained.” Did you see the truth of 2 Timothy 2:9 happening right in front of us? The world was on lockdown and socially distanced, but God’s Word went even wider and deeper. Isolation and restrictions exposed the hunger in people’s souls and prompted them to think about the deeper issues of life. 

Thanks to your faithful support, *Thru the Bible* could meet those needs and see many people meet Jesus Christ as their Savior.

No matter what 2021 brings, we will continue to spread joy to the world. 

### Let every heart prepare Him room.
