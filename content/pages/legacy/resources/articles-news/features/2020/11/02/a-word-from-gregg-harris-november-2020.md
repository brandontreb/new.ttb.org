## Beautiful Feet

### How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?

### And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!” -Romans 10:14-15

In our study of Romans, we hear Dr. McGee share: 

“We’re told that the feet of those who bear glad tidings are beautiful. One day I was teaching on *Thru the Bible* in my bare feet. I looked down at them and concluded they are not so beautiful. But God calls the feet of His sent-messengers ‘beautiful.’ I love the opportunities provided by radio today to share glad tidings. We can scale mountains, go over the plains, reach over the vast expanses of water, and go into the inner recesses of the earth with the gospel. We can go into homes, automobiles, and places of business. We’ve even been in barrooms with the gospel by radio. Radio is a marvelous way of getting God's Word to the ends of the world on our feet the Lord calls beautiful!” 

Well, Dr. McGee couldn’t have imagined where our beautiful feet have taken us in these decades since he’s been home. Let’s continue walking out the gospel until Jesus comes back for us. 

### Grateful for your partnership,
