## *And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, 
always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for 
every good work*. -2 Corinthians 9:8

 How does *Thru the Bible* hope to reach the whole world with the whole Word? The same way you and I hope to live by faith—we only can do this by God’s grace. God makes “all grace” available to us as His children. 

 Of course, most Christians would acknowledge God can do anything. But more than an academic statement about God’s power, this is a passionate promise from God to us … one that applies to every situation we face personally and that TTB faces as a ministry. Not only can God help us in every circumstance, He *wants* to! He wants us to have absolutely everything we need for every good work He calls us to do. 

Some have said, “Where God guides, He provides.” If God is calling you to live a life of faith and to bear fruit and bring Him glory—He provides what you need to do it. Believe His promise for “all grace to abound to you.” 

Thank you for standing with *Thru the Bible* as we together trust God to guide us to the opportunities to take His Word wider and deeper, to provide the resources to do it, and to keep us in His grace. Let’s pray this for each other.
