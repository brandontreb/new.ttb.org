 A Word from Gregg Harris | May 2020

## Faithful to the Task


*“Direction* and *traction*.” The TTB staff will tell you this is what I say to encourage them when they’re faced with a task that feels too big. 


*Direction*: Are you doing what God has asked you to do?               


*Traction:* Are you making headway (even baby steps)? 


Perhaps this is a good word for you today. When your heart is inclined to faithfulness, let God reward you in the process. Your job is to be obedient in what and with what God has given you to do. Throw off the pressure to perform or achieve or succeed, and entrust the outcome to God—the One responsible for the outcome. He calls you to faithfulness. 


That’s the message we remind our TTB family of when the task feels too big, the obstacles too hard, or the days too long. We’re on a mission to take the whole Word to the whole world; we need His perspective and provision. 


Praise God we’re in this together. And praise God He provides for how He guides. 


*Now may the God of peace Himself sanctifyyou completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.* -1 Thessalonians 5:23, 24


 In Christ we go forward,
