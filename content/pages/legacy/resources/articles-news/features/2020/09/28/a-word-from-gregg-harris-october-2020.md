## A Matter of Faith

 

Dr. McGee explains well the critical priority of faith in Jesus Christ in [our opening article](/resources/articles-news/features/2020/09/28/the-only-way-to-please-god). Apart from putting our full confidence in what Jesus Christ did on the cross for each of us, we have no starting line with God.  

“Without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him,” Hebrews 11:6 tells us.  

So where does faith come from? And how can people call for help if they don’t know who to trust? And how can they know who to trust if they haven’t heard of the One who can be trusted? And how can they hear if nobody tells them? (Recognize Romans 10:17? “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”)   


The faith chain is all God’s doing, but He chooses to use us in the process. Thank you for being a part of this magnificent work of God in getting the whole Word to the whole world. I’m certain of it: Someone is listening to *Thru the Bible* somewhere in the world, and they are turning to Jesus Christ by faith through grace. Today.  

And from heaven’s perspective, we get to be a part of that story.  

Grateful for your partnership,![Gregg Harris ](/images/default-source/default-album/gregg-harris.jpg?sfvrsn=38591e16_0 "Gregg Harris ")
