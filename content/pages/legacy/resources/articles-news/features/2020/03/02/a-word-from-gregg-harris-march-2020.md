**All this happened 100 years ago in 1920:** 


* The first passenger airline took off (KLM flew four customers from London to Amsterdam).
* The National Football League was established.
* Our sweet tooth was first satisfied with Baby Ruth candy bars and Good Humor ice cream bars.
* Band-aids covered their first scratch.
* The first three-signal, four-way traffic light regulated traffic.
* And on November 2, 1920, radio station KDKA produced the world’s first commercial broadcast, from inventor Frank Conrad’s garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.


**And 20 years later . . . ![High Noon Bible Class](/images/default-source/Features-and-News/high-noon-bible-class.tmb-small.jpg?sfvrsn=42e81e16_2 "High Noon Bible Class")**


In 1941, Dr. McGee began the "Open Bible Hour" radio program, airing once a week. 


In 1949, the program was renamed "High Noon Bible Class" and began airing every weekday. 


In 1967, *Thru the Bible* beganwith a systematic study of each book of the Bible. Dr. McGee took his listeners from Genesis to Revelation in 2 ½ years.


After retiring from the pastorate in 1970, Dr. McGee realized 2 ½ years was not enough time to teach the whole Bible, so he retaught the study in a five-year version. When he was done, he asked the Lord for the strength and the breath to do it again. This third version is the Bible Bus we engage with today. 


When you ride the Bible Bus, you join a long train of faithful Bible students on their way to glory.  We’re sure glad for your company and we’re saving you a seat.
