 A Word from Gregg Harris | June 2020

## “It doesn’t make any difference whatever comes to you—good things, bad things, dark things, bright things, lovely things, mean things—because whatever comes, God will see to it that it works for good in your life. You can be sure of that. It is something the child of God needs to hold onto.”  -J. Vernon McGee


You know how Dr. McGee could say that with confidence? Because he believed God’s promise of Romans 8:28: *“And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.”* 


Here’s another promise from God that our *Thru the Bible* family believes: 


God said, *“So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.”* -Isaiah 55:11


Thank you for believing God stands behind His Word. It will accomplish whatever assignment He sends it to do. No government or culture or distance or foe will hinder it. The Bible is the incorruptible, indestructible, ever-living seed of the Word of God. 


It is this Word we are committed to send—in its entirety—to every ear willing to receive it. 


Believe these things today: God works all things together for good according to His purposes, and His Word will complete God’s work in every willing heart worldwide.


Thank you for your investment in this ministry and God’s work in your heart. 


 Grateful for your partnership,
