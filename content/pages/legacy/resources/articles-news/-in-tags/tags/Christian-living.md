If you wonder if the first century church had issues, then take a look at Corinth. This young church struggled to know how to live pure, godly lives in a corrupt culture.

You are about to spend time in one of the most important books of the Bible. For millions in every generation, God uses this book of Romans to change thinking, deepen faith, and comfort hearts.

Called the man after God’s own heart, shepherd boy, and king, David experienced many storms in life. His story can be a great encouragement to you when you face trials and when problems seem to block your progress. You can read his story and know that he had similar problems. Yet born out of this life often touched by trouble, David was used by God to give us the hymnbook of the Bible, the book of Psalms—a beautiful, nuanced, and rich collection of how to praise God.

It's possible for us to go to God’s house and not worship Him at all. In order to worship Him, we must keep our focus in mind. We must keep our heart engaged.

## [The Fifth Gospel](../../features/2022/06/30/the-fifth-gospel)

The book of Acts, sometimes called the fifth Gospel, is a continuation of the four Gospels. Matthew concludes with the Resurrection, Mark with the Ascension, Luke with the promise of the Holy Spirit, and John with the promise of the Second Coming—all of these funnel down into the first chapter of Acts. And as all four do, Acts confirms the great missionary call, “Take this good news to the world!”

When you think of the grand and sweeping truth the Bible covers, from cover to cover, you might wonder why God devotes an entire book to the story of a young woman who came from a foreign country into the land of Israel.

The Gospel of John is one of the easiest books to read, yet one of the most profound Gospels to understand. We might get the surface meaning easily enough, but to understand the deep truths, we need the Lord Jesus to be our teacher.

## [Living in a World that Has Forgotten God](../../features/2022/01/28/living-in-a-world-that-has-forgotten-god)


January 27, 2022

When the Lord taught the parable of the sower, He said the seed that fell on the rock had “fallen away.” Literally, the seed grew without a root. He likened it to the person who believes for a little while and then falls when temptation strikes. (See Luke 8:13.) 
People who “fall away” are called “apostates” in Scripture. They professed to believe, but then they move away from it. They no longer believe; they have departed from the faith.

Your family tree may explain a lot about you—where you came from, who your grandfather was, and his father before him. Luke’s Gospel traces Jesus’ family through Mary’s story, back to King David, then back all the way to Adam, the first created son of God. But Adam fell from that lofty position when he sinned. Jesus Christ, the last Adam and the Son of God, came to bring mankind back into that relationship with God by believing on Him—the only way to be in fellowship with God.

What the children of Israel experienced while going through the wilderness corresponds to our Christian experience; you can translate what happened to them directly over to the life of any believer today. We can expect to encounter the same problems and expect the same solutions to work for us. Every believer will experience their own particular version of what happened to the Israelites in the wilderness.
