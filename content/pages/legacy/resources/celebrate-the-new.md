## Celebrate the “NEW” God brings to our lives


* **New life in Christ**— “… If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.”  -2 Corinthians 5:17


* **New heart**— “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you ….”  -Ezekiel 36:26


* **New name**—God will someday give us a new name reflective of our character (Isaiah 62:2).


* **New destination**—Beyond this life, present with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:8).


* **New mercies**—God tells us to begin again—every morning (Lamentations 3:23).


* **New mind**—“…Be transformed by the renewing of your mind ….”  -Romans 12:2


* **New body**—An incorruptible body, never to die again (1 Corinthians 15:54).


* **New reward**—An imperishable (incorruptible) crown (1 Corinthians 9:25).


* **New strength**—Tired? Someone will have renewed strength (Isaiah 40:31).


* **New eyes**—"For we walk by faith, not by sight.”  -2 Corinthians 5:7


* **New goal**—To please the Lord (1 Thessalonians 4:1).


* **New destiny**—“Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.” -1 Thessalonians 4:17


* **New relationship with God**—Our faith becomes sight. Something greater is coming for all of us in our relationship with God. And as Revelation 21 says, Jesus himself will come to us and let us see Him; we’ll be face to face. And we will be forever with Him with pure hearts (no sin) and glorious bodies on a new earth.


### 1 John 3:3 says that everyone who has this hope seton God keeps himself pure in the anticipation. So that’s our new marching order: Fix our eyes on Jesus and finish the course.
