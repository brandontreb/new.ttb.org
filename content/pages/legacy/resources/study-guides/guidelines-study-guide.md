### Guidelines #1


#### When You Read the Bible Through


I supposed I knew my Bible,  

Reading piecemeal, hit or miss,  

Now a bit of John or Matthew,  

Now a snatch of Genesis,  

Certain chapters of Isaiah,  

Certain psalms (the twenty-third),  

Twelfth of Romans, First of Proverbs,  

Yes, I thought I knew the Word!  

But I found that thorough reading  

Was a different thing to do,  

And the way was unfamiliar  

When I read the Bible through.  

You who like to play at Bible,  

Dip and dabble, here and there,  

Just before you kneel, aweary,  

And yawn through a hurried prayer;  

You who treat the Crown of Writings  

As you treat no other book–  

Just a paragraph disjointed,  

Just a crude impatient look–  

Try a worthier procedure,  

Try a broad and steady view;  

You will kneel in very rapture  

When you read the Bible through!  

          –Amos R. Wells


Sir Walter Scott, on his deathbed, asked Lockhart to read to him. Puzzled, as he scanned the shelf of books that Walter Scott had written, he asked, "What book shall I read?" And Sir Walter replied, "Why do you ask that question? There is but one book; bring the Bible." 


### Guidelines #9


#### Letter about Heaven


“Some time ago a minister in California announced that he would speak the next Sunday over radio on heaven. During that week the minister received a letter from an old man who was very ill. In this letter was one of the most beautiful expressions of faith ever penned. It read in part:


‘Next Sunday you are to talk about heaven. I’m interested in that land because I’ve held a clear title for a bit of property there for over 55 years. I did not buy it; it was given to me without money and without price, but the donor purchased it for me at a tremendous sacrifice. I’m not holding it for speculations since the title is not transferable. It’s not a vacant lot. For more than half a century, I’ve been sending material out of which the greatest architect and builder of the universe has been building a home for me which will never need to be repaired because it will suit me perfectly and will never grow old. Termites can never undermine its foundation, for it rests upon the Rock of Ages. Fire cannot destroy it, floods cannot wash it away, no locks or bolts will ever be placed upon its doors. No vicious person can ever enter that land where my dwelling stands, now almost completed and almost ready for me to enter in and abide in peace eternally without fear of being rejected. There is a valley of deep shadow between the place where I live in California and that to which I shall journey in a very short time. I cannot reach my home in that city of God without passing through that dark valley of shadows, but I’m not afraid because the best friend that I ever had went through the same valley long, long ago and drove away its gloom. He has stuck by me through thick and thin since we first became acquainted 55 years ago, and I hold His promise in printed form, never to forsake nor to leave me alone. He will be with me as I walk through the valley of the shadows and I shall not lose my way when He is with me. I hope to hear your sermon on heaven next Sunday from my home in California, but I have no assurance that I shall be able to do so. My ticket to heaven has no date marked for the journey, no return coupon, and no permit for baggage. Yes, I’m all ready to go and I may not be here while you are talking next Sunday evening, but I shall meet you there some day.’”


### Guidelines #10


#### You're Writing a Gospel, Someone Has Said…


You're writing a gospel, a chapter a day  

By deeds that you do and words that you say.  

Men read what you write, whether false or true.  

What is the gospel according to you?

#### Reading the Bible


It's one thing to read the Bible through;  

Another thing to read to learn and do.  

Some read it as their duty once a week,  

But no instruction from the Bible seek.  

Some read to bring themselves into repute  

By showing others how they can dispute.  

While others read, because their neighbors do  

To see how long 'twill take to read it through.  

Some read it for the wonders that are there;  

How David killed a lion and a bear.  

While others read it with uncommon care,  

Hoping to find some contradiction there.  

But, read it prayerfully and you will see,  

Although men contradict, God's words agree.  

For what the early Bible prophets wrote,  

We find that Christ and His apostles quote.  

So trust no creed that trembles to recall  

What has been penned by one and verified by all.
