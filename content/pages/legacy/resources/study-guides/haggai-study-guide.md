## Introduction


The prophets to the returned remnant were Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Haggai, the writer of this short book, is mentioned in Ezra 5:1–2 and 6:14 as one of the two prophets who encouraged the remnant (that returned after the Babylonian captivity) to rebuild the temple in spite of the difficulties that beset them on every hand. From this and the brief references that he made to himself in his prophecy, four things become apparent:


1. Haggai was self–effacing—he exalted the Lord. He took the same position that John the Baptist took: “He must increase, but I must decrease” (John 3:30).


2. He was God’s messenger. The expression “Thus saith the Lord” characterizes his message.


3. He not only rebuked the people; he also cheered and encouraged them in a marvelous way.


4. He not only preached; he also practiced.


Haggai begins his book by saying, “In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month.” Hystaspes (the Darius mentioned here) began to reign in 521 B.C., making the second year of his reign about 520 B.C. “The second year of Darius” enables the historian to pinpoint the time of this prophet in profane history. It is interesting to note that the post–Captivity prophets begin to date their prophecies according to the reign of gentile rulers. Those prophets who prophesied before the Captivity always tied the dates of their writings into the reign of either a king of Israel or a king of Judah or both. After the Captivity, since there was no king in either the northern or the southern kingdom, Haggai dates his prophecy according to a gentile king. The Lord Jesus said, “… Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled” (Luke 21:24). In Haggai’s day the “times of the Gentiles” had already begun (in fact, it began with the captivity of Judah under Nebuchadnezzar). Since that time Jerusalem has been under gentile domination, and Haggai dates his prophecy accordingly.


The theme of Haggai is the temple. The reconstruction and refurbishing of the temple were the supreme passion of this prophet. He not only rebuked the people for their delay in rebuilding the temple, but he also encouraged them and helped them in this enterprise.


Haggai constantly referred to the “word of the LORD” as the supreme authority. He willingly humbled himself that the Lord might be exalted. His message was practical. It was as simple and factual as 2+2=4. The prophecy of Haggai and the Epistle of James have much in common. Both put the emphasis upon the daily grind. Action is spiritual. A “do nothing” attitude is wicked. Both place this yardstick down upon life. Work is the measure of life.


Haggai’s contemporary, Zechariah, was visionary and had his head in the clouds, but pragmatic Haggai had both feet on the ground. The man of action and the dreamer need to walk together. First Corinthians 15:58 can appropriately be written over this book: “Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”


There are two keys verses in this book: “Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD…. And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God” (Hag. 1:8, 14).

## Poems & Quotes






### Haggai Introduction


“When a man prays for a corn crop, God expects him to say Amen with a hoe.”  

          –Bishop Mooson, from Georgia


### Haggai 1:9-15


“First there was an appeal to the mind. He told them that at the very beginning. He said, ‘You say it is not time to build God’s house? I want you to think about this, how is it that you are living in fine houses?’ And that was the appeal to the mind. The second was the call to consider. And that was an appeal to the heart. He says, ‘Set your hearts, lay your hearts to this.’”  

          –Dr. Frank Morgan


When asked what is the mark of a great statesman, Gladstone said, “A man who knows the direction God is going for the next 50 years.”


### Haggai 2:5-9


Mid blended shouts of joy and grief were laid the stones  

Whereon the exile’s hopes were based.  

Then foes conspired, the king’s courage retraced  

His throne against the enterprise arrayed,  

And now self-seeking apathy in vain all hearts  

The pulse grows faint, the will unbraced  

They rear their houses, let God’s house lie waste.  

So heaven from dew and earth are stayed  

There comes a swift messenger from higher court  

With rugged message of divine import  

Your ways consider, be ye strong and build  

With greater glory shall this house be filled.  

He touched their conscience, and their spirits stirred  

To nerve their hands for work, their loins regird.
