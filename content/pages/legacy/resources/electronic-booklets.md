The Christian life can feel like taking one step forward, then two steps back. In 2 Corinthians, the church is challenged to “grow up” in Christ, and we are reminded of God’s unfailing grace, even in the face of sin and failure. These eight lessons from Dr. J. Vernon McGee will encourage you to keep walking forward in the right direction as you grow in your faith.

The Gospel of John, a favorite book of the Bible, gives us the story behind the stories of the Gospels. Though it is one of the easiest books to read, John is also one of the most profound books to understand.

If ever you wondered if Jesus is really human, study Luke’s Gospel. As a doctor, Luke revealed the down-to-earth compassion that pervaded Jesus’ life, revealing Him as God in the flesh. Our teacher, Dr. J. Vernon McGee, leads us in seeing how Jesus is the Son of God, our great High Priest, touched with the feelings of our weaknesses, able to extend help, mercy, and love to us.

What makes Mark’s Gospel unique from the others? The difference is in the details. Mark, telling the disciple Peter’s story, gives a private glimpse of how Jesus served. He’s constantly acting on others’ behalf. He lays aside a king’s royal robes (like we saw in Matthew) and girds Himself with the towel of service. These 9 lessons from Dr. J. Vernon McGee will stir your heart to serve like Jesus.

The Gospel of Matthew bridges the gap between the testaments, swinging back to gather up prophecies and going forward into the future, the first to mention the church by name. Matthew presents Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah and King. And though originally written to Jewish people, we today can see Jesus Christ in a fresh new light.

The subject of Revelation is not beasts and bowls of wrath. The real subject is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Sin-bearer bringing creation to its rightful place. If today you’ve wondered why God doesn’t deal with the evil in the world, look to a day yet future. Jesus is called “Faithful and True” because He comes to execute the long-time program of God. He will make good on God’s promises.

The Song of Solomon is one of the most beautiful love stories in the Bible—yet not many people read it. The Jews called it the Holy of Holies of Scripture. What’s good to remember when you study this controversial book is that Solomon wrote this love story about married love as a parable of God’s love for Israel, and now we see it also as Jesus’ love for the church and His love for us, individually. (From the Sunday Sermon, "The Greatest Love Story Ever Told.")

Expectations are cruel companions. Rarely do they deliver and most assuredly, they leave us disappointed. Dr. J. Vernon McGee—who was no stranger to life’s challenges—leads us back to the wilderness to learn how not to turn bitter in those moments of dashed expectations but, instead, how to turn to God.

Tired of the hustle of the season and want to focus your heart on what really matters? A perfect read for the season, “The Christmas Story,” takes you on a journey through Scripture—beginning in the Garden of Eden, to the manger in Bethlehem and Jesus’ death on the cross—as you are reminded of Christmas’ true meaning and God’s great love for each of us.

(Psalm 22) Instead of standing beneath the cross and passively listening to Jesus utter His seven last sayings, view the crucifixion of Christ from a new position—from the cross itself. Look with Him on those beneath His cross and see what went on in His heart and in His mind as He hung there. Examine what occurred in His soul as He became the sacrifice for the sins of the world. Because as He was suspended there between heaven and earth, He became the ladder let down from heaven to this earth so we might have a way to God. (Was "An X-Ray of the Cross.")

John is known as the *apostle* of love, but Zephaniah is the *prophet* of love. He tells us about another side of God's love, though—the love of the Great Physician who is willing to take His children into painful surgery to root out the disease of sin in our lives. Learn that God loves you just as much when He is subjecting you to surgery as when He overwhelms you with gifts. (Was "The Dark Side of Love.")

The only way God can accept a sinner and make him righteous is through faith in Jesus Christ. That’s the great truth being left out of churches today. God refuses to accept law-keeping or good works. The very moment someone says, “I’m depending on doing this or that for my salvation,” it means two things: He is trusting his works, and he is *not* trusting Christ. Salvation is *only* by faith in Christ.

As part of God’s design for us as humans, we are made up of three parts—the intellect, the emotions, and the will. God directs the gospel to all three, and He invites us to respond in all three parts of our being. That's the way to have a full-bodied faith. (From the Sunday Sermon, "Looking at Faith in the Laboratory of Life.")

The Spirit of God is called to help you, to strengthen you, to relieve the loneliness, ease the grief, and calm your fears. He is your advocate in time of fear and trouble, with you in the desperate hour of life. When our soul cries out for the Comforter, He comes alongside us. When we know for sure that "the God of all mercies" is with us in all life’s troubles, we can live by faith and not by fear.

(1 Corinthians 12-14) Every believer has a gift from the Holy Spirit. God sovereignly gives the gifts, and He gives them as it pleases Him. Why? So the body can function.

The words of John 3:16—arguably the most well-known verse in the Bible—are simple. But they are also so profound that it's a wonder any one of us really knows what they mean. Why did our Lord enter and pass through this world? Because you were here, and He wanted to save you.

It was a profound revelation for the ancient world to learn there are tears in God’s eyes. God in tears? It’s a startling thought. But the Bible tells us that God has been in tears. The Gospel writers record three times in the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ when He wept, and those tears reveal the heart of God.

Revelation does not originate or begin anything, but it brings to complete conclusion what began somewhere else in Scripture.

In one of the last conversations Jesus had with His disciples before the Cross, He told them He wanted to continue having fellowship with them even though He would be in heaven and they'd be on earth. This was a new way to have fellowship—something they’d never seen before. Then He showed them what He meant. We, too, can have that sweet fellowship with God.

(Matthew 6:9-13) A study of the Lord's Prayer lays on the heart of God’s people the urgency for knocking on His door, the necessity of asking, and the importunity for seeking. Dr. McGee gave this message with the prayer that it would stimulate God’s people to “pray without ceasing” (1 Thessalonians 5:17).

(Jude 20-25) This booklet could very easily be called, “What’s Wrong with the Church Today?” But the real question to ask when a particular church or teacher seems off is—*Do they know and follow the real Jesus Christ?* If the answer is no, then they are apostate. Dr. McGee gives us a historical review of how the church got in this place and then seven timely words of instruction from the book of Jude of how God’s people can survive these “latter” days in which we now live. (Was "What Can Believers Do in Days of Apostasy?")

 This question has caused more confusion, difference of opinion, and division than any other. It has always been so. Some think it’s not really important that He was who He said He was. But we cannot trust Him unless we have confidence in His person. The real test for anyone is: “What do you think about the Christ?” (Matthew 22:42).

God said, “I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau.” What a strange thing for God to say. What does it mean? We find out in the little book of Obadiah. Here’s a preview: God hated Esau because of his pride. *Really?* you might say. *Is that all?* It makes very little impression on us, because we have lost our sense of the proportion of sin. But pride says, “I can live without God.” Find out what God thinks of that. (Was "Evolution and You.")

Most of our trouble and problems can be traced back to the poverty of our prayer lives. In the Gospel of Luke, our Lord uses a few brushstrokes to paint four portraits of prayer.

 Songs have a way of touching us in the hardest seasons of life. This is especially true for those who write and compose songs. David experienced this—you can read his story and identify with how he faced problems similar to ours. He wrote Psalm 62 as a song, just one in the great hymnbook of the Bible, the book of Psalms. He wrote out of profound experience. His psalms encompass his own life, and Psalm 62 expresses David’s heart during the greatest crisis of his life. In it, we can see the depth of his soul laid bare.

After the angel Gabriel brought the message of redeeming love and the remembered joyful concern of God for man—first to Zacharias, then to Mary, and then to Joseph—it was time for man to respond … only it was the women who broke forth in song. Before the story of shepherds and angels, there was this story of two women and two songs. Together they provide a proper perspective of the real Christmas story.

 Was it a surprise when Jesus, God’s Son, was born in Bethlehem? Not if you read the Old Testament carefully. His first coming was prophesied for centuries. Will it be a surprise when Jesus returns for His church? Not if we read the New Testament carefully. In fact, the faithful are already expecting Him. In this brief doctrinal survey, Dr. J. Vernon McGee tells us the secret to expecting Jesus, then and now. It’s as simple as this: Believe Him. (Was "They Should Have Expected Him, and So Should We.")

 In every generation, courage wears the face of the ordinary person who refuses to back down to evil or injustice but instead chooses to stand up for what is right or righteous. We’d recognize some of their names, but most are known only to silent witnesses and some only to God. But God sees them all. Here’s a true account of a man named Daniel who repeatedly stood up for God, even when it cost him everything. See what God thought of that in this stirring message from Dr. McGee.

 James seems to have little in common with contemporary Christianity as we know it today. James was austere, rugged, serious, and solemn. He was also very practical. He believed Christianity had to be put in shoe leather. If you couldn’t walk it out, then it wasn’t true Christianity. So he took us to God's classroom and described what a faith that works looks like. Practically speaking, he wrote about the skills and techniques we need to faithfully live the Christian life.

 Aside from killing Goliath, David is probably best known for his sin with Bathsheba. This message presents four things that happen to every believer when they sin, while at the same time asserting that God offers forgiveness to those who love Him.

(1 Corinthians 1:18) Think about the cross of Jesus Christ. Did you know that what you’re thinking of right now tells a lot about you? Dr. McGee explains how our opinion about the cross tells us about the condition of our hearts. We’ll look at the lives of real people in history who chose to believe the cross was the instrument of their salvation and those who thought talk like that was just foolishness. Come to this study with an open heart to all God has for you—because of the cross. (Was "The Cross Divides Men.")
