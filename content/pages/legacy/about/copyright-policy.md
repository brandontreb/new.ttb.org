## Permissions Guidelines on All Print and Audio Material


To Those Who Would Like to Share Dr. McGee’s Teaching With Others:


We so appreciate your heart to share Dr. McGee’s teaching by bringing as many people as possible the whole Word to the whole world. Dr. McGee’s teaching is copyrighted and *Thru the Bible Radio Network*  (*Thru the Bible,* TTB) actively maintains control of any and all physical and digital media that is distributed (e.g., radio, podcasts, websites, apps, CD’s, MP3’s, and any other media available). Dr. McGee did not want his messages edited nor did he want outside unauthorized parties to use his teaching for their own personal profit. He also did not want listeners to become detached from the ministry and its overall goal: to bring the whole Word to the whole world. The further removed the distribution of his teachings gets from the ministry, the less likely people may be to pray for and financially support this mission. We appreciate your heart to help bring Dr. McGee’s teaching to as many people as possible while complying with the desires of Dr. McGee and *Thru the Bible*. 


*Thru the Bible* is glad to grant you written permission to share Dr. McGee’s teaching materials, for your work, provided you agree to our guidelines and adhere to any updates in the guidelines as they are amended from time to time.

## Copyright FAQ





#### 
[May I reprint excerpts from the newsletter, edited messages, or any other TTB material in my church newsletter, bulletin, etc.? What about making copies of "The Inside Story," Dr. McGee's Notes and Outlines, or other materials to share with members of a Sunday school or Bible study class?](#collapseOne)





Yes! See the Permissions Guidelines at the top of this page for our full policy, but as long as you adhere to our guidelines, you do not need to obtain our written permission to quote excerpts in free church publications, scholarly papers, Bible studies, social media, and the like.







#### 
[Can I record the program from the radio or my computer to listen to later or share with friends?](#collapseTwo)





Yes! Just remember that the copied materials must be given out completely free of charge. If you'd like to share something with someone else but don't have the personal resources to do so freely, let them know about our free [online resources](/resources) and [programs](/programs/the-5-year-study).







#### 
[I'd like to help advertise the ministry of TTB! Do I have permission to place an ad in my local newspaper, print up fliers, buy ad space on a billboard, etc. to promote the program? Will you write the ad for me?](#collapseThree)





Yes, we encourage our listeners to help advertise TTB in any way they can--and over the years friends of the ministry have come up with some pretty creative ways to do so! Because we have a policy not to spend resources on advertising in these ways, we will not create or provide ad text or artwork for you. But you're welcome to use any information or text here on our website to create your promotional material.







#### 
[Why do we restrict the reselling of copied audio programs?](#collapseFour)





As stated above in our Permissions Guidelines, Dr. McGee did not want his messages edited nor did he want outside unauthorized parties to use his teaching for their own personal profit. He also did not want listeners to become detached from the ministry and its overall goal: to bring the whole Word to the whole world. The further removed the distribution of his teachings gets from the ministry, the less likely people may be to pray for and financially support this mission. We appreciate your heart to help bring Dr. McGee’s teaching to as many people as possible while complying with the desires of Dr. McGee and *Thru the Bible*.







#### 
[Can I stream the audio program in mp3 or other formats from my own website as long as I'm not charging anyone to listen to it?](#collapseFive)





We would be glad to grant you written permission for this type of rebroadcasting. To submit a request for consideration, please send your request to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#176772657a7e64647e7879645763637539786570).







#### 
[May I put a link to www.ttb.org on my website?](#collapseSix)





It's a great blessing when friends of the ministry share it with others, so please feel free to add a *Thru the Bible* link to your website.
