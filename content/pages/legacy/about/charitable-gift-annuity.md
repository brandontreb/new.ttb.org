title: "Charitable Gift Annuity"
description: "Thru the Bible with Dr. J. Vernon McGee - Taking the whole Word to the whole world"
---




Your gift today can provide you with income for life while helping to fulfill Dr. McGee’s vision of bringing the Whole Word to the Whole World. We are pleased to make these investments available to our faithful supporters.  

  

Dr. McGee never wanted to be involved in “promotion,” and if we had concluded that this was a form of promotion, we would not have moved forward. We have determined, however, that the benefits to our donors make this an outstanding way to support the ministry without incurring unnecessary legal expense or obligation.  

  

The minimum investment is $10,000. The rate of return depends upon the age of the donor, who must be at least 50 years old to participate.  

  

If you would like to be used of the Lord to advance His work by investing your treasures in an annuity that will benefit both you and TTB, please [contact us](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ee87808881ae9a9a8cc0819c89) and let us know of your interest. We will be happy to discuss ways for you to financially bless the ministry with annuities as well as many other creative and tax-saving methods for you to donate cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, life insurance, income, collectibles, and more. (Please note that charitable gift annuities are not available in New York, Hawaii, or Canada.)
