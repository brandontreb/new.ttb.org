#### 
[What is your Doctrinal Statement?](#collapseSix)





The doctrinal statement of Thru the Bible Radio goes into quite a bit more detail than what is presented here, but this in simplified form is what we believe and practice in our ministry:


* The plenary, verbal inspiration of the Scriptures;
* The Trinity;
* The deity of the Lord Jesus Christ as the Nicene Creed states it;
* That Christ came to this earth to reveal God and to redeem man and that He died a vicarious substitutionary death upon the cross for the sins of man;
* That Christ sent the Holy Spirit into the world to call out a body of people to His name which is called the church;
* That man was created perfect but that he disbelieved and then disobeyed God; that man fell into sin and today the entire race of Adam is totally depraved and incapable of saving itself;
* The pre-tribulational, pre-millennial coming of Christ to take His church out of the world;
* That Christ will come later to the earth to establish His kingdom, and His coming is the hope of the world.

[How can I get copies of the opening and closing hymns?](#collapseSeven)





The opening hymn is "How Firm a Foundation" by the John Lundberg Men's and Women's Choruses, and the closing hymn is "Jesus Paid it All." These can be found in most hymnals. Unfortunately, recordings of these songs as they are heard on our program are not available.







#### 
[Why don't you offer the monthly specials on the edited messages earlier, so we can use them along with the radio teaching?](#collapseEight)





Actually, we are following the course of study the way Dr. McGee set it up. He wanted notes and outlines available prior to each study, and recommended follow-up study using the edited messages
