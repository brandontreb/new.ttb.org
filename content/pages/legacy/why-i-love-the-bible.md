## We Want to See Your Face


Let's celebrate the kick-off of a new 5-year journey through the whole Word of God in April 2021!   

  

In 30 seconds or less, answer the question, **“Why do I love the Bible?”**
Is it because it gives you hope?



Because it points you to Jesus?



Because it comforts you? Challenges you?



Why do you show up every day on the Bible Bus with your Bible open?


Record your answer (on your smartphone or computer) and then **[upload your video here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/HD4arhP2pIoE4h6PSz8l)**. (If you have problems with Dropbox, you can also send or share your files with [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89cbe0ebe5eccbfcfac9ddddcba7e6fbee).) We can't wait to see your face!
## How to film your video


* If using a phone hold it in landscape mode, so horizontally like a TV and not vertically like you're talking on your phone. The camera should be eye level with the person talking.
* Make sure there are no windows behind you, or else the footage will have white, blown-out backgrounds. Ideally, have some light source on your face, whether it's from a window or a desk lamp.
* Begin your video with "I love the Bible because ..."
